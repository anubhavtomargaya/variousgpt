[{"question": {"id": 8, "text": "Thoughts on near-term food delivery business growth?", "speaker": "Vivek Maheshwari"}, "answer": {"text": "We believe that GOV growth of 20% plus should be able to continue in the near term as well. Currently, we're trending at 27%-28% YoY growth. So that might fall a little, but by and large, we don't see any specific concerns on the demand side at this point, at least in our business.", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}}, {"question": {"id": 12, "text": "Timeline for reaching 4% to 5% margins in food delivery?", "speaker": "Vivek Maheshwari"}, "answer": {"text": "It's hard to comment on the exact timeline there. The idea is to grow the right way and invest in areas that we need to while we continue to scale. So, we're not working with a particular timeline as a goal and then working backward from there. That's not how we are operating right now. But as you can see, the margin has been expanding over time while we continue to invest in growth and the long-term health of the platform. And there are so many variables as you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s demand, which over the last two years has been unpredictable, and there is competition and so on. We\u2019ll do the right things and hopefully continue on that journey on margin expansion from thereon. And in a few quarters from now on, we should get to that range we\u2019re talking about, we\u2019re not very far from that now.", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}}, {"question": {"id": 14, "text": "Impact on profitability from adding 2,000 stores and competition?", "speaker": "Vivek Maheshwari"}, "answer": {"text": "At this point, we don't think that will happen, and that's why we have said that we believe the business will remain profitable. But of course, as you are saying, there are so many variables and factors at play here. So it's not like what you're saying cannot happen. It can, but it doesn't look likely right now. From a longer-term perspective, we have fair confidence that this business can be as profitable as food delivery in terms of margin, if not more. By when we get to that margin is a function of the pace of expansion and the competitiveness in the market, which is hard to predict in the short term. But from a long-term perspective, we feel fairly confident that we'll get there.", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}}, {"question": {"id": 16, "text": "Any updates on the District announcement?", "speaker": "Vivek Maheshwari"}, "answer": {"text": "Nothing, Vivek. I think we've mentioned how we think about the Going-out business in the letter. We will continue executing on that and share more updates as and when we have them. So nothing specific beyond what we have shared in the letter.", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}}, {"question": {"id": 21, "text": "Impact of Google Maps APIs reduction on profitability?", "speaker": "Vijit Jain"}, "answer": {"text": "No, Vijit. That is not going to impact our profitability meaningfully from here. Because I mean, what we read in papers is more of a headline number, but at least what we've analyzed, it doesn't seem to impact our profitability meaningfully at this point.", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}}, {"question": {"id": 23, "text": "Increase in delivery-related charges QoQ?", "speaker": "Vijit Jain"}, "answer": {"text": "There is some increase, but what you see in the P&L is a function of the amount net of customer delivery charges, right? Yes, customer delivery charges have been declining as our Gold proportion increases. But net of that, there is no meaningful change to the delivery cost number.", "speaker": "Kunal Swarup"}}, {"question": {"id": 25, "text": "Flattish fixed costs in quick commerce business?", "speaker": "Vijit Jain"}, "answer": {"text": "The total fixed costs that you would compute are a function of multiple factors. One is corporate costs, and then there's also marketing cost. Some of these costs balance each other out sometimes. There could be some increase in corporate costs due to the scale of the organization increasing but at the same time, there could be a quarter where we spend a little less on marketing. So that's what could happen, corporate costs would have grown, but you don't see it at the total level.", "speaker": "Kunal Swarup"}}, {"question": {"id": 28, "text": "Will District be a separate app?", "speaker": "Vijit Jain"}, "answer": {"text": "So yeah, we're planning to launch this as a separate app and brand. We want to take the advantage of the traffic that we have on the Zomato app. So it's going to be pretty much like how we built Blinkit, which is a separate brand and separate app, but still making sure that we keep our cost of customer acquisition lower using the traffic that we have on the Zomato app.", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}}, {"question": {"id": 33, "text": "How will you differentiate in new markets with new stores?", "speaker": "Sachin Salgaonkar"}, "answer": {"text": "Even if you look at the 113 stores we opened this quarter, a significant number of them were not in NCR. Our focus is to maintain a high quality of service. In the markets where we are expanding, we believe the service level, both in terms of the selection available to customers and the consistency of service, is not at the same level that we provide. So, when we are opening into these locations, we are finding success in getting customers to start adopting our service over time.", "speaker": "Albinder Singh Dhindsa"}}, {"question": {"id": 37, "text": "Any insights on Blinkit take rate this quarter?", "speaker": "Sachin Salgaonkar"}, "answer": {"text": "I think the take rate is dependent on a lot of factors. We also had some amount of food inflation, which was about 2 rupees 40 paisa when it came to the AOVs for staples and other products. When there is more inflation, sellers usually tend to pass along some of the cost benefits to the customer to maintain competitiveness. Take rates are usually a function of many of these things. Since a large chunk of the business is still FMCG, food, and staples, those factors are also significant when we look at take rates. Overall, we are seeing our proportion of products outside the core category increasing, and those also have higher take rates. But I don't think you can read too much into the product mix based on the take rates.", "speaker": "Albinder Singh Dhindsa"}}, {"question": {"id": 42, "text": "Thoughts on store sizes for new openings?", "speaker": "Sachin Salgaonkar"}, "answer": {"text": "Our preference is always to open larger stores, and our current inventory of the stores that we're looking to open are on average larger than the ones that we have. But a lot of it is dependent on the real estate available in the cities. So it usually tends to be a mix.", "speaker": "Albinder Singh Dhindsa"}}, {"question": {"id": 49, "text": "How many Blinkit stores will be owned or managed by you?", "speaker": "Aditya Soman"}, "answer": {"text": "Our attempt is to make sure that every new store that we open is eventually run by a local partner.", "speaker": "Albinder Singh Dhindsa"}}, {"question": {"id": 51, "text": "How much growth in Blinkit was driven by new SKUs?", "speaker": "Aditya Soman"}, "answer": {"text": "We've been consistently adding SKUs over the last four quarters. Some of our categories have become a significant percentage of the platform. As a result, they are now starting to contribute meaningfully to the overall growth number because the customer wallet share increases for us when that happens.", "speaker": "Albinder Singh Dhindsa"}}, {"question": {"id": "54", "text": "What is the growth driver for GOV in food delivery?", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}, "answer": {"text": "GOV growth is largely a function of order volume growth, with Gold membership contributing about 50-55%.", "speaker": "Akshant Goyal"}}, {"question": {"id": "55", "text": "What is the current order count for Blinkit stores?", "speaker": "Aditya Soman"}, "answer": {"text": "We're still taking two to three months to reach the desired scale.", "speaker": "Albinder Singh Dhindsa"}}, {"question": {"id": "60", "text": "Do you expect to grow at 30% GOV for the next five years?", "speaker": "Swapnil Potdukhe"}, "answer": {"text": "From FY20 to FY24, our food delivery GOV has grown at a 30% CAGR.
