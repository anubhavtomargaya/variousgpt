      "{'text': \"Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to Morepen Laboratories Limited Q4 FY24 conference call, hosted by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode, and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star then zero on your touch-tone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Tushar Manojani from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited. Thank you and over to you, Mr. Manojani. Thanks, Renju. Good afternoon and I welcome you all for the fourth quarter FY24 earnings call of Morepen Labs, hosted by Motilal Oswal Financial Services. From the management side, we have Mr. Sushil Suri, Chairman and Managing Director. Mr. Ajay Kumar Sharma, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Nishant Doshi, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. And Mr. Vipul Kumar Srivastava, Company Secretary and Compliance Officer. Sir, over to the management for the opening remarks. Good afternoon. This is Sushil Suri, CMD of the company. Good afternoon. Yes, sir. Afternoon for this side from all then. Good afternoon, Mr. Nishant Doshi here from all. Yes, Tushar, should we start? Yes, sir, please. A formal warm welcome to all the participants who are there on the call today and of course it's a nice afternoon. I'm sure that most of you might have gone through the results by now. We have shared with the stock exchanges and with the website yesterday. I know that I'm sitting in front of the computer, so I have access on the numbers, but please forgive me if I'm talking too many numbers. But quarter as a whole, it was an outstanding performance for the quarter, but year as a whole also the company has done pretty well. Since it's an annual result, so in the annual thing, we discuss the company as a whole also, but on the quarterly basis, these are the pure simple numbers. Just to appraise the participants who are joining with these type of calls for the first time, we have primarily two type of business segments. One is medical devices and one is the bulk drugs or APIs, which are modernly called. So 80% of the revenue comes from medical devices and APIs. And API, of course, is our traditional business, our old business, which is our cash cow. And the company started from the API only. Medical devices is relatively new. When you say relatively new, it's still almost 20 years old now. But medical devices is the fastest growing business in the company. Then back in 2015, 16, 16, 17, we have 500, 600 core company. Medical devices is only 13% of the revenue. But now medical devices is 26%, more than 26% of the revenue. This is growing much faster. The company in last seven years has grown with a CAGR of 16%. CAGR is CAGR, compounded annual growth rate. Company has grown at a CAGR of 16%. But medical devices has outsmart and grown at CAGR of 28% year on year. So that's why I'm saying it's the fastest growing segment within the modern thing. And medical devices, we are talking primarily of the home medical devices. We are into point-of-care medical devices. Point-of-care is used in hospitals also sometimes. You have some patient monitors and other things which are used on the bedside of the patient. But we are specialized in the home diagnostic. And we have built a beautiful brand, Dr. Morton, around customer service and around more consumer awareness, more one-on-one interaction with the customers. We sell our goods directly to over 3,000 distributors all over the country. And of course, network of more than 125,000 retailers. So we are a consumer company and a typical diagnostics company. And we are not into testing and other that stuff. We are a device. That's why we always call it devices. The second business, of course, is Bulgarian APIs, which is an established business, giving good cash flows and growing at its own good speed. Between these two, this is 80%. Then we have a range of formulations and OTP products, which is typical in any pharma company. But medical devices, that is our unique position. Moving specifically to the so-called key positioning of the company, the key achievements, what we have been able to do. In both medical devices, we have two leading products, BP monitor and glucose monitor. One is a glucose monitoring machine. And wherein you buy the meter, and then you buy the strip battery. One is a blood pressure monitor. We are the market leaders in both the products. And we are manufacturing it in-house. In-house means we are manufacturing it out of a factory. And we are manufacturing it for basic bare PCBs. And there's a full assembly line for that. I'll come to that later. And within API, we are category leaders in six APIs, six small products. So I don't want to confuse you with the name. But just to mention, these are Loratadine, Desloratadine, Montego Card. And there are three more products where we are third and fourth. So there are six products where we are market leaders. So all APIs are exported. Around 68% of our business in the API is from export. Hard currency, dollar export to advanced countries, regulated markets. And of course, the company has been consistently growing, both in top line and bottom line. With the help of the internal cash approval, the company has been able to clear all its old debts with all the banks. And in whatever structure we are, we are a debt-free company. It's negligible debt. When you say negligible debt, it means a simple car loan or other things. Rather, we have fixed deposits in the bank, which are sometimes used for an overdraft facility. So we are a debt-free company. So as we talk, we are celebrating the 40th year of our journey. And we proudly say that we have entered into this 40th year with more energy, more agility, and more performance-oriented approach. We are making more and more decisions in the company on how do we improve our performance and how do we better our prospects. That was a broad theme. Coming specifically to the operational performance, during this year, the revenue has grown by 20%. From 1,424 crores, we have grown to 1,704 crores. So almost 20%, 19.97%. 20% growth in the annual revenue. On a quarterly basis also, the revenue has grown 16.5% for the Q4. So consistently for the nine months also, there was an increase. And here as a whole, it's 20% increase. And just to update you that last year, the year was not so good. But because post-COVID, there was a lot of inventory in the markets, and the markets were a bit slower. Now there's a good comeback, and the fresh buying has started. And particularly in medical devices, because it is primarily based in India, so we have better access and better controls. So the comeback and the rollback is much faster. So medical devices have grown by 35%. API business has grown by 14%. Some countries are still shying away. And of course, on the positive side, last couple of years, import prices, particularly from China, were disturbed. And rather, they were higher than expected. But now the import prices have also softened, and our margins have increased in the last three, four quarters. We're happy to announce. And of course, you can see in the base of it that the company's overall productivity and margins have gone up. A picture of the company, which is the earnings before interest depreciation, and of course, the taxation. So it has doubled, more than 101% increase from 85 crore in EBITDA last year. We have 173 crore, almost 173 crore in EBITDA, 172.6. And profit after tax also is 150% up. It's two and a half times, from 38 crores to almost 97 crores. So 39 crores to 97 crores, annual path has gone up. It's almost 150% increase. And as I shared that we are a debt-free company, so whatever is annual EBITDA, all we're seeing is the cash generation. So with 83 crore of these cash generation, this year we have 164 crores, 168 crores of cash generation, which is almost 100% up. So we are seeing that whatever the temporary blip was there in the last year, so we have covered quarter after quarter. It has taken a little longer than usual, but we are very comfortable with the margins profile now. So if we go specifically to the segment-wide, as I shared that our main lead segment, the fastest-growing segment is medical devices. So within medical devices, our DC monitor and gluco monitor are the two products. Gluco monitor, as per the industry report, we have 19%. Of course, the competition may be almost similar or less, but in our actual strict supplies or regular quarter-to-quarter sales, we are leading. And similarly, in case of BP monitor, we have 18% market share, as done by the industry report. All these products are manufactured in-house, and we started production back in 2015. And of course, earlier, these were imported. And glucometers and BP monitor, both are manufactured from the bare PCBs. When you say bare PCBs, it means it's a plastic sheet. And after that, we do the mounting. There are sophisticated automatic machines, which are used to do the mounting of the registers and all that electronic parts of it. And facilities are not just temporary facilities. These are approved by International Date for Registers, or ISO 13485, which is the global standard for medical devices. And of course, as we speak, medical reservation guidelines are being tightened day and night, every month and month, and we are happy to see that small traders and small manufacturers start something and grow something. Over time, many people have come. So those things are going out. So we are happy that our facilities are better and controlled and approved by the International Presidency. Other than BP monitor and glucometers, we have thermometers, we have pregnancy kits, we have orthosupports, day scales, oximeters, stethoscopes. But all said and done, 95% of the revenue comes from glucometers and BP monitors. Glucomonitor is the main product. If we talk about total revenues, revenue last year was 327 crores, and this year it has touched 443 crores. So it's a 35% increase in the annual revenue of the medical devices. On a quarterly basis also, before it was lower than the last three quarters. Even in the slower quarters, there's a 28% increase in the annual revenue of this division. And on a quarter-on-quarter basis, there's a 28% jump and 35% over there. And as we have entered already the Q1 of the next year, we are already facing shortages of the products and capacity constraints because the demand has picked up and the pace is to be maintained. So we are trying to do more and more backward integration and control the supply chain. The 35% increase in one year doesn't mean that it is a peak. Even a year before, in FY22 also, we were 428 crores. So this number is very comfortable, and we keep growing at similar trends, so we see a lot of upside within this business. Coming specifically to the glucometers that I shared, that the maximum business within this trade, out of 447 crores, 342 crores is coming from glucometers and the street fields. Here I would like to share with all the participants that the way this model is working is that this is more like, you know, that printer cartridge model. We have to first sell the meters, and then after that we continue selling the strips. So here the more and more meters we sell in the market, so more and more strip customers we are generating. So we keep investing behind the meters, and we create start-ups. We keep creating new and new customers. Over a period of last 10 years, more so in the last 4-5 years, we have been able to install 1.16 crores, 11.6 million meters in the market. So that is like our customer base. We have a customer base of 11.6 million meters, which is 1.16 crores. And on those meters, we can use regularly and repeat buying. It's more like insurance. It's more like a regular income. And we sell 36 crore strips. Last year we sold 36 crore strips on the basis of this 1.16 crore meters. So already in the market. The number of meters sold has more than doubled in the last 3 years. And similarly, the number of strips sold has also doubled in the last 3 years. So the more meters we install, the more strips we keep on selling, and that is the business model. We keep investing and keep reaping the harvest also. As we are talking, by end of March this year, we have sold more than 1.5 million strips, which is almost 150 crores more than the population of India. But that's a cumulative number. That's just a statistic. But on an average, we sell 35 crore strips. And this year we are expecting maybe to go up to 40 crore strips, maybe more. So the whole idea here is to acquire a customer, keep the customer happy and satisfied. So we have a full service team available all over the country. There are company-owned service centers. And all the retainers and our sales team also, they double up as sales reps. And we provide a lifetime of free replacement of the meters in case there is any problem, no questions asked, because we are here for the customer service. And going ahead, the way the world is changing, so any company who has more or better relation or contact with the customer, he will be giving. So that is the way we have created this consumer brand. That's what the whole philosophy and ideology of Dr. Morton is, that we create long-term relationships with the customer. And Glucomonitor is one of the examples. That once you have a meter, that every day, every time, whenever you are checking your sugar levels, you would always keep in mind. And once you are a customer for Glucomonitor, then it is easy and comfortable buying another product from the same company. So most of the time, the customer is the same. The guy who has sugar problem, they have BP problem also, or vice versa. So it's the same customers, so BP monitor and Glucomonitor. So it's a very interesting business model. And we don't have to look out for new customers. And to the same customers, same set of retailers, same family. Maybe within one family, one problem, one person has sugar problem, second person has BP problem. But after a certain age, it goes together. So coming specifically to the BP monitors. BP monitors is a very simple model. Unlike there, we have to send strips also. Here we sell directly the meter. So of course, there is no further revenue here. So here also, the business has grown 36% this year. While the number of meters sold has gone 29%, from 8 lakh meters to 10 lakh meters, 10.5 lakh meters. So we sell almost 1 lakh meter every month. We will take some season off season. So we have cost 1 million mark second time. During COVID also, we have sold more than 1 million meters. But earlier at that time, it was being imported. Now we have produced in-house 1 million meters and sold 100% from in-house capacity. So of course, we are adding more and more SMT lines and more and more dedicated lines to produce more meters. And we hope that this business also will keep on growing at a similar pace. This year, of course, it has grown 36%, because last year numbers were a bit slower. But again, getting an average of 28% carrier over the last 7-8 years, we are hopeful that it will keep growing at a similar pace. There is still a challenge that this mill is not very high and lucrative as super monitors, because there are two components, the consumable and the strip. But here, yes, we are basically capitalizing on the docu-market brand and giving a better service to the consumers. So when we talk of the manufacturing lines, as I shared that we are manufacturing all the meters from their PCBs and the PCBs are first mounted to their printing machines and there are SMT lines and there are injection molding lines, which is why we can basically produce those sidebars, front, back. And of course, there are separate printing machines for the LEDs, so LEDs are prepared separately. Then there are multiple tests. And in the strips, then there are the bulk strips, which we are still importing from Korea. And sheet cutting is happening in India. But to have a longer-term supply contract and to have a longer-term control over our supply chain, we are planning to have a, not planning, we are working to have an in-house production of the strips also. So, of course, we are working with our Korean counterparts to have the technology here and have a controlled manufacturing setup in India. Hopefully, once we have that, we move in some business from Korea also to India. But even if we do not get any regular business from them, but if we have the strip manufacturing in-house, we have the complete meter manufacturing in-house, starting from their PCBs, including all the moving parts and including the screen printing, then we have a full supply chain for the BP monitors and glucose monitors, both. And we can work on the export also. As of today, we are exporting small quantities under Dr. Morton brand in Thailand and Middle East. So, of course, Nepal, Bhutan were launched much earlier. But still, export is miniscule. But as we go forward, so we see that in case we have a full backup and we have full capacity, so we can start exporting to, I would say, markets like US and Europe, every single chain can be as big as our complete India market. Let's say, for example, if we are selling 20, 25,000 liters in India, big glucomotors in India, maybe one single order from any one of the chains, big chains like Wal-Mart, CVS, or Wall Street. And even if we get one single order for one year, we should be happy to double up our capacity or maybe three times. So, we see a lot of opportunities. And thankfully, this line is still very technical, very sensitive, and not many organic sales are there. So, most of the supplies have been imported. And government is trying to control those unregulated means where people are trying to, for sake of better word, people are trying to smuggle up things and trying to just supply things in the market without any service, without any backup. So, imports are becoming more and more difficult. And even the bare CCGs have been recently brought under the anti-dumping duties. So, we are thankful to government that government is putting more and more efforts to cut down on the imports. The more control on the imports is there, more and more people will be encouraged to have Indian production. And that will save us a lot of the costly exchange also. And of course, the overall cost cutting in supply chain. Because COVID time, everybody has seen that irrespective of the cost, so China was acting crazy, they had increased prices 30%, 40%, 50%, and they were playing balls even on the freight containers which was there. So, we are trying to have the same thing in-house. It is in line with Honorable Prime Minister Modi's decision that we should be the hub, we should be the manufacturer, and we should not be a buyer. We don't want to be just another person. So, we are happy we are on the same side. So, going forward with the particular devices business, like I said that we are confident of maintaining a similar flow pattern. So, we have noted down in our presentation that what would be the growth drivers. So, the number one growth driver, of course, would be capacity extension because now it's the manufacturing, we have to produce whatever thing we are talking. If I have to increase my top line by 50%, 40%, 100%, 50, 40, whatever number. So, we have to have capacity for that and the backward integration. And capacity backward integration certainly has to match with the latest technology and labor cost, automation. So, that's why we are happy to work. Then, of course, the reach side within India, of course, we have a sufficient reach. As of today, we have almost 125,000 retailers. We want to go to 300,000 retailers in the next five years. So, as of today, we are more focused on north, on north and north-west. But going forward, south is one area where we need to make more efforts and we will double up the sales there also. It's a much bigger and much educated market, but we have not been able to invest behind that market. So, that's another area within India. Then, second, as I shared that there will be direct exports by under-company labels and a private label also. So, which is a slow process, but it's a much bigger opportunity than doing little exports under our own brand. Then, of course, we are expanding the sales team for India also, for export also. Retail coverage is what we need to be focusing more because it's a service-oriented product. So, we need to be present closer to the customers so that the retailers get the comfort and the buyers get the comfort. And, of course, more and more sales training and more and more approaches so that the sales team has a better productivity. So, these are, I would say, for both drivers where we see new sales coming up. Coming specifically to the new initiative, other than gluco-molecular and gluco-molecular, there are multiple products that we are working, whether it is immunodigestive state, cell culture, and, of course, some other industrial and mechanical products. But major here is the continuous glucose monitoring, CPM, where you get a patch on your shoulder and you take readings on the phone. We are working on these, but, I think, little away from what we are teaching. So, this industry is very fragile in terms of technology and other things. Thankfully, both in BP Monitor and gluco-monitors, it's a very stable product and it has been in the market for the last 25 years. But we keep our eyes and ears open, that even if any new technology comes, we should be able to adapt to that technology. So, we are ahead and we are on track. So, we have started investing in the research. We have three research labs now. One is in Uttar Pradesh for the last four years. So, last year, Baddhi Dabbar also started. And this year, our lead in the last quarter. So, for the last two quarters, we started our lab in Bangalore also. So, it's more for electronics. And Okhla lab is lead-based with biosensors and biochemistry and industrial design, I think. And Baddhi, of course, the research is more towards the skin-up and fusion. So, whatever you could use in your class, we'll be able to do that. That's on the R&D side. So, of course, we will come to the questions. I know that I have spoken too much in terms of questions on medical devices, but I'll give you a quick run on the API business also. API business, as I shared that this business has been a very dominant business and a cash cow for the company. So, here we have six products where we are market leaders. Loratadine, Destoratadine, Montefiore Plus. All three products fall in the anti-allergic category. When we say market leaders, we are number one market leaders here in the global market in terms of volumes. And two more statins, Rosinastatin and Atornastatin, we are number four. These are cholesterol reducers. And there's another anti-allergic product, Taxofenadine, where we are number three in the global market as per the industry report. So, these six products alone, 90% of our business comes from this. We have a stable revenue on these products. And of course, the revenue is growing as the numbers are speaking. Other than this, we have more products in the anti-allergic category. And we have a big portfolio of anti-diabetic products, cardiac products, and similar lifestyle products. So, Morphine does not operate in traditional antibiotic and infectious diseases and so-called old products. We all have high-value products, which are more than $100, $200, $600 a kilogram. And, of course, going forward, sometimes the prices are huge. But we are not an industry. For example, antihistamines, metformin prices are $4, $5 an item. So, we don't have these. So, that is why we have better efficiencies and better productivity in terms of reactor capacity. So, reactor capacity in this industry is measured in Km. So, we had a very low capacity of only 300 Km till last year, which has increased to 400 Km. And our production is much higher than the industry's production. So, talking of the percentage here of the revenue, Montelukas has been getting 27% share, Loratarin and Desloratarin, similar products, taking together around 23%. Atorvastatin is 17% market share. Montelukas has gained 14% market share. Loratarin and Desloratarin is around 9%. This is the operator. Mr. Suri, there is static in the line. What I will do is, I will just disconnect you and reconnect you. Right? Yes. Just give me a moment. Please stay connected. Reconnect the management quickly. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the management line has been reconnected. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon again. I don't know what time you guys heard me, but we were talking that we are market leaders in six APIs. So, Loratarin, Desloratarin, Montelukas, we are number one market share. And two statins, Atorvastatin, and Loratarin, we are number four. And there is another anti-allergic product, Sexofenadine. Again, we are number three in the line. So, between these six products, we have 90% market share. 90% of our revenue comes from these six products, where we have stable products and these are all growing. And we are market leaders. We are proud to say that. But other than this, we have around 30 more products, which are new products. And those are also increasing as we go forward. And that 10% of the new products will slowly go up to 30% in the next five years, so that the revenue generation from the new products will increase as these products mature. So, we are exporting to over 80 countries, which is a regular export. We have got over 500 customers worldwide who are buying regularly from us. And 60% of our export business comes from repeat customers. And when you say repeat customers, it doesn't mean one year, two years. There are customers who are buying from us since the last 10 years. Of course, it means there may be some slippage in one year or two years. They did not buy. But old relationships is what the value here is. So, the contacts and relationships, for example, if we had our first customer was in 2001, 2002, was Sandu. It's a part of Novartis. They're still working with us. Perigo was one of the customers. They're still working with us in the last 25 years. So, that's a value of relationships and customer relationships we have been able to build. We have around 17% shares of sales and revenue coming from the U.S. market, and around 18% from the Europe market, and 26% from APAC region, Asia region. MENA region is very low, around 3%, and of course, 31% still from India. And 68% exports. South America is around 4%. All the markets have been growing consistently. This year, U.S. market has grown 32%, which is very good. As against Europe, it has grown only 7%. We all know that Europe has been disturbed because of various reasons. And otherwise, also during COVID, also Europe was most affected. India market has grown 17%. Of course, in volume terms, India market has grown much higher. But in value terms, it's 17% in spite of the higher values. In spite of the lower value, it has grown 17%. APAC region has grown only 2% here. And South America has grown 53%, but the numbers are small, so growth looks higher. But primarily, the growth is coming from U.S., Europe, and India. And we look at the revenue numbers. API revenues have grown from 823 crores to 940 crores. There's a 14% increase in annual revenue. On a quarterly basis, this quarter was excellent from 270 to 271 crores. There's a 25% increase in the quarterly revenue. And one thing I'm happy to share with you is that even though there was a price reduction in terms of sales and, of course, the raw material prices also, so there's a 39% increase in the volume of the goods sold. We have sold 311 metric tons of the drugs taken together last year, last financial year, FY23. But in FY24, only 311 crores. We have sold 432 crores. There's almost 40% increase in the volume of goods sold. It means thanks to our increase in capacity, we have to produce more even to get to the same level of growth. Even to get 14% growth in the annual revenue, we had to produce 39% more quantity to keep our targets. So we were on the toes the whole of the year. But now, thankfully, the capacity has increased. And if the market goes up, certainly the revenues will multiply much faster. But on the other hand, we are exhausting our capacities, and we have to keep investing in the capacities. So that's why we are always under the pressure of expansion because we didn't have any major expansion in the last 20, 25 years. All the expansion is happening only from internal approvals. And another interesting thing which I want to share with you is that during this financial year, we had a new product, Faxoprene, a new in the basket of these so-called blockbusters. We had this product, but there was not much revenue coming. We got U.S. FDA approval back in 22 here for this product, Faxoprene. So exports have started last year, and there's a 300% growth in this business for this current year. So if we are able to maintain those levels, we should be very good. That's on the EPA side. And I'm sure you keep reading on the website and on our regular LinkedIn and other places that companies are very active on filing patents and filing DMFs, CPs in Europe. So now we have 155 patents in our international property. Our library of DMFs is going up. Worldwide, we have 349 drug master files for all the different products. Twenty-six drug master files are in the U.S. only, and there are CPs in Europe. Of course, we are proud of our chemistry skills, and we have new polymers for which we get patents. So almost 340 people work with all these QC, QA, R&D to make all these drug master files and patents and other things. So 43 new products we have launched in the last five years. Of course, all the facilities are inspected and approved by U.S. FDA, all the EPA facilities, EDQM, PMDA Japan, Enviva, Brazil, of course, China, NMPA, and of course, WHO-GMT. So whatever we are doing is as per the international standard, and we have a long track record of product quality and customer relationships. And we shared in our last call also, which we are still maintaining, that we have a mill 483. There was a mill observation by the FDA in our last three inspections. Out of three inspections in two plants, we had no observation by the FDA, and we have a metric of mill observation. And not that we are perfect, but as compared to the industry standard in general, APIs do not attract many this thing because our product history is a B2B. But as it is to other peers in the formulation industry, the magazine hasn't been very friendly. So we hope to maintain these standards, and we are happy that the team has been working very nicely. So that's all about the basic, I would say, both businesses we have talked, medical devices and API. Other than this, we have formulation and OTC. And in OTC, you all know that we have a very popular product, Bernol. So it's more than 75 years of legacy. We have purchased this plant from Racket Kit Pyramid. And of course, before that, it was owned by Nol Pharma. It's an international brand. And now it has – it's a synonym with burn. More important than burn, it's a synonym with Janan, rather. Jalega to Bernol is Jalega. So it's a very popular brand. And of course, we have a separate distribution more for OTC and formulations. So we are expanding that also. Dr. Martin has already become a household name. And of course, Bernol, Lamellate, we have Omega-3, PainX, FeverX, HeadX. There are multiple products, and these are sold online also. In formulation, we have brands like Saltum, Ritmix, Hepapentad, and Intelback. We have some international products. We are in – for the probiotic. And probiotics are getting very popular these days. We have it in the formulation. So on the revenue side, the formulation business has grown by 10%. Formulation and OTC taken together have grown by 10%. But during the quarter, it was a bit slow. March quarter is usually slow in this business. Formulations have grown 2%. Seventy-one percent of the business comes from the medicine side, and 29% of the business comes from the OTC side. On the distribution side, we have more than 5,000 distributors, 5,100 distributors. We are present in 3 lakh outlets, 3.28 lakh outlets taken together. And all over the country, we are present. 580 people are there in all the states for the selling. The GenMix are distributed separately to a separate company. It was a single distributor. But otherwise, we have got service centers. We have got distributors all over the country. I'm not getting into detail of plans. Financial numbers have already been circulated. So as I shared that gross revenue during the quarter – I'm talking about the quarter now. During the quarter, the gross revenues have gone up 16.5%. EBITDA has gone up 182%, from 18 crores to 52 crores EBITDA. EBITDA level has gone from 5% to 12.31%. So it's more than double as a percentage because the revenue has jumped, and of course, gross margins have increased. Profit before tax also has almost three times, from 3% to 9.88%, from 11 crores to 42 crores. There's a 279% increase in value. And on percentage terms, it's almost three times. Profit after tax – that was profit before tax. Now profit after tax, as was last year, was very low, 2.25%. Profit after tax is 6.73%. This is almost 259%. So those are the quarterly numbers. On an annual basis, I shared earlier, 20% revenue growth, 101% EBITDA growth. And, of course, EBITDA is 10.13%. After now, time has come in double digits. Profit before tax, 143% increase. PAT is 150%. PAT is still low, 5.67%. We are actually – as the revenue goes up, the PAT will increase. So still we are in that 100-crore bracket. 97 crores is the PAT. So on the financial ratios also, we see significant improvement. That's the ultimate parameter. Our KPI is retracted with the ratios. Earnings per share has gone by 144%. So based on the March quarter results and annual results, the earnings per share is 1 rupee and 88 paisa. So for a 2-rupee share. And return on equity is 11%, as against 5% last year. So return on equity is also doubled. Return on the capital employed, which includes the working capital also, is almost doubled from 7.31% to 15%. Asset turnover ratio we have been maintaining in spite of the new addition of machinery. It's almost nine times. And that equity ratio is negligible because we are a debt-free company. It is 0.03, which is very, very good. That's all about the listing. And, of course, since the time is short, so we'll go to the question and answers. Thank you. But on the expansion side, we are expanding on the medical devices, increasing more capacity, backward integration. We are expanding capacities in the APIs. Of course, we are supplementing the working capital. And, of course, research and development still remains the focus. That's all from my side to begin with in short and sweet. And I will go back to the anchor, and we can see the question and answers, if there are any. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Anyone who wishes to ask a question may press star and 1 on your touchtone telephone. If you wish to remove yourself from the question queue, you may press star and 2. Participants are requested to use handsets while asking a question. Ladies and gentlemen, we will wait for a moment while the question queue assembles. The first question comes from the line of Nisarg Vakaria with NV Alpha Fund Management, LLP. Please go ahead. Yes, sir. Thank you for your very comprehensive commentary to begin with. It was quite helpful. I have a couple of questions. I'll first start with your medical devices segment. Sir, can you please explain the economics of this business? How much do you have in cross-block for 400 crore of top line? And how much working capital? And what is the sort of EBITDA margin that you make in this segment? Of course, the exact numbers, Ajay can give, our CFO is here. So, Ajay, you can keep it broadly. This business is very efficient. It does not have much fixed asset requirement. And the asset turnover is more than 10X. Ajay can give the exact numbers. On the working capital side also, the working capital cycle, of course, has become a little higher now because of our imports, because of the self-manufacturing. But otherwise, it's typically a cash-negative working capital because we got imports from China, Korea earlier. And now, and of course, we sell in advance in the market. So, we do not give any credit in the market. So, that's why we have been able to create and demand a prestigious brand because we don't give credit. So, it doesn't have huge working capital in the market. But yes, because of the increased longer manufacturing cycle, so our inventory levels have started going up. But Ajay will give you the right numbers. And on the EBITDA side also, Ajay can speak. Ajay, can you speak now? Yes, yes. EBITDA for devices business is 12%. Sorry, how much? 12%, 12%. Okay. We have improved over the last year. Last year, it was 8%. So, as far as gross losses are concerned, it is around 43 crore rupees. And investment into working capital is 60 crore rupees. And all investment into capital card is almost 100 crore rupees. What sort of gross margin do you make in this for 12% EBITDA? Gross margin, we do 25% around. Okay, thank you. Second is now coming to your other business, which is the API. If you look at your company level margins, our company level margins are closer to 10.5-11%. Our medical devices is at 12% margin. What sort of margins do we make in the API business? And what sort of margins we make in the formulation business? Ajay, can you explain that? Yes, sir. For API, our EBITDA margins are in the range of 18%. Improved over last year, it was around 16% last year. So, as far as formulation is concerned, so, currently we have negative margin here because we are just building our capacity. So, for this formulation, we have negative. So, at... Sir, can you quantify that number? Because 18% EBITDA you do in API, 12% you do in devices. So, what sort of loss you are making in formulation? Formulation, this year we have done 19.5% EBITDA loss. In this quarter, how much you have done? This quarter. This quarter is around 4% of this. So, sir, again I am asking you, see you do the math yourself. API, you said 18% margin. Then you said 12% margin in devices. So, how can we make only 4 crore loss in formulation? The numbers won't add up, no? No, no. In fact, when we talk about these numbers, these are the business standalone numbers. Then we have common expenses, which we do not allocate to any separate division. So, if we... Corporate expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses. When we talk about business, we talk about only the standalone. In fact, it doesn't include any allocation. These numbers are all standalone. And then we have our OTC with us, which is also making some losses. There is this financial year. So, if you include corporate expenses as well, so for this quarter 4, so with that I will give whatever we have already mentioned in the... Okay. Secondly, if I am not mistaken, there is 600 crore of gross block on your balance sheet, right? Yes, yes. I think that was last year. This year we have around 500 worth of it. Yes, and for the medical devices, you don't have too much of gross block. You said it's 40 crore rupees, right? Yes, 42 crore rupees. Yes, so balance gross block is all dedicated essentially to API? Mostly to API and then foundation as well, because foundation, we have spent money in the foundation as well. And in fact, we have also built some capacity for our ANDAs as well. So, the top line has not been realized against that. So, that will come maybe in the next 12 to 10 months. So, mainly APIs and foundation and then devices. Yes. Okay. What is the peak revenue potential that you have on the existing gross block in the formulation and API business, assuming you don't have to do CAPEX? You see, this year we have done around 950 crore of top line and API. So, we should expect another 150 crores to 200 crores more. So, still around 1150 crores we can do with existing with small addition here and there. And foundation, we have already built in the CAPEX. So, foundation, we have a matching top line of around 100. So, to my understanding, this top line could be stopped till maybe around 300 crores. We can achieve three times the top line, whatever we have, because CAPEX, we have already done it. So, we'll be able to realize upside this year as well as next year. So, you'll see revenue growth in the solution particularly, at least three times in coming two years, maybe two and a half times to three times, yeah. Okay. Sir, you know, just re-asking this question, if you look at any pharmaceutical company, and if you look at the margins that they do in formulation is closer to 20% bare minimum, like bare minimum, I'm saying, and API, they do between 12 to 14%. But our company level margins are at 11% this quarter. So, is there something which is depressing these margins or is this the steady state margins going ahead? You see, let me share with you that our distribution business, it is very small. So, it is around 45 crores this year, but we have incurred losses into this because our team is small and we are not able to really achieve the break-even in the formulation. So, that is one. Then we have manufacturing. We have done capacity addition only this financial year. So, our salary cost was too high. So, we must see this turnaround in this financial year. So, whatever this negative has really brought down our overall EBITDA. So, that at least this financial year should be break-even. And the formulation distribution business, we have losses. So, I think that also should also come down if not really break-even. So, we'll see improvement into this business. Otherwise, in API and devices, we are fairly good and we will be able to improve our EBITDA margins, something in both the business. And particularly, the formulation business will show better visibility in the next 12 to 15 months, yeah. Devices are generally, devices are basically, essentially how much of the devices are sold online versus general trade? Online is around 10%, 9 to 10%. Rest is all general trade. Yeah, general trade. Yes, with that distribution. And who would be the large branded players in this space other than you in India? In both products, we are different. In Glucometer, it is Roche. And in BP Mall, it is Omran. So, we are competing in, at both sides, we are multinationals. And of course, we are much ahead of them on ground and real numbers. And nothing official about it, but we hear that Roche is already upholding its division and they are withdrawing their sales team because they are not super competitive at the retail level. And they were enjoying the monopoly because they were just selling brand. But now, the markets are acting competitive and the customer is more demanding. So, multinationals are losing their charm. Other than this, there are small, long tail of those so-called import and sell companies, which because they fly by night, they come and go. Okay. And this is a doctor prescribed product or this is an OTC? It is pure OTC. It is pure OTC. I understand. Thank you so much for answering. I have something on the margins. Yeah, sorry. I have something on the margins. So, I think like I explained that we are still struggling to find a headway in the formulation, but you would understand that as I shared in the beginning, 80% of revenue is between medical devices and API. So, honestly, that's our growth story and that is where we want to go. Formulation and OTC, we are, I would say, not on the runway. And we are just trying to see, okay, how can we make this business profitable and maybe at some stage divest it or get a partner or get into a separate company. By that, both these businesses are into separate companies now. Dr. Maltin is a separate subsidiary. Formulation is a separate subsidiary. So, obviously, we are working to at least these businesses breakeven and we lose, we don't have a drag on the profitability. But on the other hand, certainly there's, even after corporate allocation, our overall beta is lower. But in devices, for example, I was telling that this is a printer cartridge model. The more printers we sell, the more cartridges we will be selling. So, more meters installed. So, the number of meters installed will also grow very smoothly. For example, 20 lakh meters, 25 lakhs, 30 lakhs. But number of sticks will keep on increasing because for every meter we have installed. So, that delta is increasing every time. So, the margins are increasing. So, we try to accelerate these numbers for the next five years. And we are seeing that devices margins will go up to 80, 90 percent. Because that's how the math works. So, similarly, if... Just to ask you on this point, which you mentioned, a small question. This 400 crore sale that we have closed for devices this year, out of that 400 crore, how much sale comes from these strips? Around 373 crore strips only, meters and strips. 342 crore is the device that is globally distributed. Yeah. 342? Put together. Yeah, around 70 to 10. 70 percent of the sales is coming from... This is basically, I would say, our bread and butter. And that I was telling in the presentation also that BP Monitor is just an add-on and it will give us enough money to pay the bills. No, sir, I understood. My question was slightly different. I was saying in Glucometer, you sell a meter and then you sell a strip, right? Now, strip is a repeat business. What is the absolute quantum of the strip business that you have per year? I think you have separate numbers. I don't have, but it is around 85 percent is a strip business. Around 85 percent is strip? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I would think that your margins in strip are substantially higher than your meter. Yes, sir. Basically, that is where we do not officially share the so-called separate numbers because meter is sold at a certain MRP, then there are strips. Of course, there are certain schemes which are shared with the distributors, but the ultimate objective is that, okay, we sell more and more strips. I understand. The strips are, of course, a high-profit number, and as we go forward, the meter would be growing at, say, 20 percent. Strip business will grow at 30 percent. That 10 percent is pure profit. Okay. During COVID time, for example, there was a shortage. New meters are not being installed. So, we had a margin of 21 percent that year because meter installment installation is ongoing. Strip users have gone high. You are checking, everybody is checking this sugar level three times, four times. So, strip usage goes up and awareness is going up. So, this is going to up that. Okay. Great, sir. So, thank you for answering my questions patiently. That is so nice. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Tushar Sardar with Athena Investments. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity. One of my questions was, of course, on the composition of strips, which you have answered. My second question, sir, is, you know, on the API side, you have, in the presentation, given six molecules where you have leadership. So, what percentage of your API business is out of these six molecules? As I shared, around 90 percent of the business comes from these six molecules, and in 10 percent, we certainly have a long tail, but within that 10 percent also, there are five, six main products. For example, loratadine, lestoratadine, montelicose, rosuvastatin, taxofenadine. These are six products, which is, I would say, we call it key products. And then there is a dapagliflozin, linagliflozin, linagliptin, onnifartin, epixaban, enoxaban, faxaniliptin. But these are all new molecules under patent in one country or the other, so they take some time. Okay. Okay. And any of these molecules you think can become big, other than these six? Actually, at Peshawar, we all plan that everything should become big, but markets are real. So, sometimes, for example, thetagliptin was expected to be a blockbuster, but 20-30 people launched in the market, so product bombed. Sometimes, innovators played some games. So, we are aggressive in everything, but it depends on the market. You have a relationship, and you mentioned Perigo, which is a very big player. It becomes easier to penetrate the market, right? Otherwise, pharma manufacturing… Perigo gave me the example of taxofenadine, since we have a relationship with Perigo and loratadine, so, and it's an OTC company. They are a private-table company. So, they picked up taxofenadine also. So, even though taxofenadine… It all depends which market opens at what time. The last couple of years, particularly Europe's supplies and Europe's approvals have been disturbed. Of course, Europe was disturbed post-COVID. So, we keep on seeing a lot of opportunities, but honestly, we do not see any forward-looking triggers in this platform. So, I am keeping my mouth shut. Okay. Thank you. Lovely. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Madhu Rati from CounterCyclic Investment. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you for your question, Rishabh. First, I wanted to understand this 18-19 volume of electromargining medical devices that you have said that we can achieve. So, this will be from our own manufacturing of the strips, or is there an effort to achieve this kind of margining in the segment? This will be 100% out of our own manufacturing, and that is our key strategy that we do not import, and we do not even do a lot of outsourcing also. The machines are not very costly. The only thing that needs is a space and a building. So, we are building huge sheds to accommodate our injection molding and other machines. So, we are trying to reduce our dependence on import and reduce our dependence on the third-party manufacturers who order us every day. So, we are trying to get better controls. Okay. And so, since you have a fair idea that Roche is winding down its retail business, so are there any plans to just sell the strips that can go into the Roche machine and take that business away from those guys? These machines, Madhu, are very locked machines. So, Roche machine cannot use my strips, and my meter cannot use their strips. So, these are customized meters and customized strips. So, they work with a particular software. I am calling it a printer carting model or a Gillette shaving razor model. So, we cannot use anybody else's thing. But on the other hand, the advantage is in case one player goes out of the market, or even if it is a temporary disturbance, so that's an opportunity to capture the market. We can sell our meters, and we can gain that market. So, that's an advantage. But we can't use their customer base. And Roche has been there in the market for 20 years. Maybe they are there for the last 15 years. We don't know. So, maybe they have a similar meter base. But regular meters, active users, we have more active users than that. Okay, got it. Sir, just a final question. Can we see our formulation business being at least breakeven on F525? Yes, yes. It is on the cart. That's how we are working on it. So, we are naturally not doing major expansions and trying to see that, okay, first we should start making money. Because it's a people-driven business, and we have to have sales force, and the doctor, marketing, and everything. So, we are trying to control those efforts, so that first we start making money. And as I shared last year, we had major expansion in the capacity. And because earlier, our machines were very low-capacity machines, slow machines, and we were not able to recover even our costs and salaries. So, now we have sort of high-speed machines, which are having much higher capacity. And we will be able to have a higher volume. And you all know that Govand is pursuing for Genvix. So, we had a lot of volume coming from Janoshidi, which is a Govand scheme. So, we are supplying to Janoshidi. Janoshidi business has more than tripled this year. So, if we continue having regular business with fast capacity, so this is a very profitable business. But we had issues, so we are not shying away from that. But as an industry, we know that we have to work on it. We are on to it. But yes, our business model and our growth story, growth plan is not in combination. We are more of a leading devices company with 28% capital. That's our business model. Okay. So, can we expect that there will come a time in the range of 14, 15 volumes for the whole year FY25? I won't be giving any guidance. But if we continue growing, so you can see the growth numbers or if you are seeing the candles. So, based on that, I think we should be able to maintain a healthy rate. I am not giving any specific number. I know the regulations are… We are just at the back of the annual calculation based on the margins. That's fine. That's it. Thank you. Yes. The data margins certainly are increasing in years and years. And certainly, once the Now, this year, we have seen that just with 20% increase, our data has doubled. So, it means expenses are all covered. Expenses are going up. We are not going to increase expenses. We already have whatever we have. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madhu. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ketan Atavli with Robo Capital. Please go ahead. Sir, my questions have been answered. Thank you. A reminder to all the participants that you may press star and 1 to ask a question. Once again, a reminder to all the participants that you may press star and 1 to ask a question. Next question comes from the line of Tushar Manadane with Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited. Please go ahead. Sir, just on the medical devices, apart from… First of all, on glucometer itself, if you could share, you know, what are the new developments in terms of product side which can give an edge compared to competitors for us? Yes, Tushar. Glucometer, as I shared, it's a very stable and robust product. And we sometimes do not disturb even the model that we launch. For example, the VG03 model which we sell to the trade and the VG05 for online. So basically, the customer is used to a particular technology and this technology is successful and is working. But as we go forward, there may be some improvements within the models with some electronic components, some screen components, which we also keep on doing. There's a Bluetooth possibility, but we have tried Bluetooth operations also, but people are not ready to pay 200 rupees extra for Bluetooth because not many people are used to it. Normally, these devices are used by senior citizens. So, but the interesting development here is, as I shared earlier, was the continuous glucose monitoring, the CGM, the patch technology. So, our R&D team is working on the patch and we are trying to develop our own patch. The existing product in the market, Abbott has a product that is very costly. They charge 14,000 rupees for a 14-day patch. So, now many apps have come there, they give it a discounted rate. Even then, it costs at least 5,000 rupees for one patch for 14 days. And we have two patches for a month. It's like 10,000 rupees a month cost just to test your sugar. So, I would say India is a poor country, so we can't afford that. There may be a certain half percent, one percent people who can afford that. But for the masses, we are trying to bring down the cost to maybe, say, 1,000 rupees per – 1,000 rupees monthly cost or 1,000 rupees per patch. So, but that's a long dream. It may take two to three years' time. But other than meter and glucometer and BP monitor, what we are working on is the technology. For example, strip manufacturing. Once we understand the strip manufacturing, then we are basically trying to learn the art of making a strip. That humble strip has got a circuit, it has got a biochemistry, it has got enzymes. So, once we know how to make a strip, today we are making a strip for glucometer, for the sugar testing. Tomorrow, we have to make a strip for cholesterol testing. So, we can make a strip for the cholesterol testing also. Similarly, we developed technologies for very accurate pregnancy tests last year. For the same technology being used to manufacture a test for dengue or for malaria, because now we know the chemistry and we have got all the moving parts to make a deck and a card and testing. So, basically, the way the industry works is it works on technology. If I've got some technology, so I can replicate that technology in any other field. Second is the paraphernalia of making all those things and all the electronic part and plastic part and assembly lines and quality controls. That's the group. Understood, sir. And to start, once you have the in-house manufacturing of strips, any geography you would like to call out for exports where the initial focus would be? Initial focus, of course, would be on Europe and U.S. only. So, we need a CE certification for them. So, post-COVID, Europe has been very slow. There have not been any inspections after that. And many of the time, they have reduced their staff also. But we feel that U.S. will pick much faster because we are in touch with all the chains which I named and all the big boys, the Walgreens, Walmart, and CVS. And I'm not quoting anybody's name, all the big boys, I'm saying. So, we are in touch with them, and they are happy to register and acknowledge our product. But they have long procedures. But the volumes are very high, and the numbers are very high. In Europe, the system is a chain. There are private hospital chains. There are pharmacy chains. So, if any of the chains start buying from us, so we would be happy to supply. Otherwise, this Middle Eastern market is absolutely uncovered. There's no manufacturing there. And even this South American market is absolutely uncovered. So, there is a Brazilian company who is working with us on BP monitors, gluco monitors. Somebody wants pregnancy kits in Mexico. So, I would say these are random opportunities which will keep on coming. But if we have the capacity, the whole issue is of capacity. Now, we are coming out of the cocoon, so we don't have to think of 500 crores. We have to plan for 5,000 crores. For 5,000 crores, we have to have capacity. Understood, sir. And lastly, this Korean company from whom we currently procure the strips, how many? Would you like to share how many strips they make annually? That's a private company. We do not have their number. But I'm sure whatever sheets they are supplying to us, maybe two to three times they are doing it for themselves also. But the fact remains that we are their largest customers. And typically, they want to exit this business because they also have some roots in China, and everybody is disturbed because of the China thing. So, they also want to establish a base in India. So, we feel that once we have a base, irrespective of the quantities, we are in line with the thing that we are a manufacturing hub, and that's a huge opportunity we are sitting upon. And that's why I was telling that we see this as a much bigger opportunity than cracking our neck on the formulation business or on any other generic business. So, we see that this is a unique opportunity which we are eyeing upon. Well, thank you. That's it for me. Thank you, Tushar. I think my time is already lost. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tushar Sardar from Aetna Investment. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for the opportunity again. One question is, you know, any plans to demerge the medical device business? Yes. Separately? Yes, it is already on the cards, and we have already taken shareholders' approval. So, we are working on the regulatory procedure that how would it be… Of course, it won't be a demerger. It would be more of a lock, stock, and barrel sale, as you can explain better. So, it won't be a demerger. It will be like under 11 UA. But we are still seeing the regulatory part first because there are new medical devices rules, so which we are supposed to procure separate licenses or new licenses for each and every production. So, since we have capacity limitations and we have so-called production limitations, we don't want to, so-called, have a gap in the market. So, we are trying to find the right time and opportunity where we can have some overlap and apply the license to the new company and when we get license to the new company, then start this. We are still working on it. But within this initial year, we'll certainly start moving the business into devices. And then at that stage, it can have its own capital event. It can have its own fundraising or at whatever stage. We don't have any plans on the cards, but it is free to do that. And what is the time frame to reach 18-19% margin in this business, if you said devices business? That I was telling you, we have done some math for the next five years. So, of course, virtually it keeps on increasing. It keeps on increasing year by year as we go, because that's how the business is planned. But we never know when do we get some big jackpot and big orders. But because of the listing guidelines, I would like to keep quiet on this point. So, we can't speak much in the future. And the last question, sir, how much is corporate overhead which is unallocated? Ajay, you can speak on it. I think it's around 4-5 crores every month. Yes, yes, around 4 crores per month. 4,48 or 47 crores was last year. That includes all the IT, HR, account, finance, corporate office, legal. So, everything is at one place. Thank you, sir. Lovely. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Double Chain with Sequential Investment. Please go ahead. Hello, sir. I just wanted to understand that on the last call you had mentioned that you aim to sell around 100 million meters, glucometers, in the next five years. Is that guidance still that you aim to maintain? 100 million is the market size, and that's the estimated market size of the diabetics in India. No one knows what is the right number. So, there is a WHO number. They say 50% of the market is not addressable. These either people don't even know that they have diabetes or they don't care or it's in villages. So, it is assumed that the addressable market is 50%, which is 5 crore meters. We are at 1 crore now. So, even if I want to double up from 1 crore, if I have to go to 2 crore meters, we need a 27% growth rate in three years. So, if I want to go to 3 crore meters in, say, four years, basically I would say if we keep on expanding 25%, 30%, we still have room, even if we assume 5 crore is the number of the addressable market. But we are seeing in the last five, seven years that awareness level is increasing, market is expanding, as the reach is expanding, affordability level is increasing, and most importantly, health concerns are increasing. Thanks to COVID, people are alert and active now. So, the market is expanding, and so are we expanding, and we're still talking India. If you talk of global market, India is just peanuts. So, I would say that we see a lot of opportunities, but it's a wide canvas, so which we can make our own right. So, the next thing is, like, the threats also would obviously keep increasing in that proportion. So, I just wanted to ask, like, in FY25, then how many meters that you aim to sell? Look, as I shared that, that number is almost, I would say, going steady, not that it is constant. From 22 crores to 22 lakh meters, this year it was 24 lakh meters. So, next year, maybe 30 lakh meters. So, naturally, that's, I would say, this control which we have, we always know that, okay, which market is lacking. If, naturally, we are launching a new market, we have to give more meters. And if we are in the same market, we know what is the absorption level. We never keep high inventory in the market. So, on the other hand, we always see that, okay, if we have sold so many meters, is the strip sale coming or not? There may be some markets, you place meters, the strips, people don't come back. So, people don't use. So, maybe some markets have more, I would say, strip sales, some markets have lower. But on average, the whole idea is that we keep on growing the meters. So, this year we have planned for 30 lakh meters. And, of course, next will be 30, 36 lakhs, 40 lakhs. So, keep on expanding. And, of course, we watch the endgame, the rule here, I would say, the formula here is how many strips do we sell per meter? So, as of date, it is around 150 strips per meter sold. If we sell 25 lakh, 24 lakh meters, so we have sold 36 crore strips. So, this 150 number should go up. Because the usage should go up. 150 becomes 155. So, that is also an indicator. During COVID time, it was 155. Because the usage was very high. So, this number, so long as my number goes up, according to the current year number, we are not calculating on an average basis. Because even if we say 1 crore meters, active meters may be 20 percent or 30 percent. We don't know. So, based on that number, our usage is much higher. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I know it is a new business, a new game, so little more questions, but interesting. Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of question and answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Yes. Thank you very much for the patient hearing and I appreciate some interesting, insightful questions. And I would like to only add that it is just the beginning of the story. So, India's story is unfolding very nicely globally. So, we are a traditional, hardcore manufacturing company and we want to focus on more and more in building new technologies and more basis of quality, FDA, ISO. So, robust manufacturing model based on low cost and a global capacity. So, that is our model. And of course, with more and more contact and relationship with the consumers, both in the medical devices and the API side. Happy to have any questions. If anybody has any questions, please feel free to write an email to Nishant in Bombay or to Nitika who is your contact communication person. Thank you guys. Have a good day. Thank you so much. Thank you. On behalf of Modi Lal Oswal Financial Services Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect the line. \", 'meta': {'num_chunks': 8}}\n"

But quarter as a whole, it was an outstanding performance for the quarter, but year as a whole also the company has done pretty well. Since it's an annual result, so in the annual thing, we discuss the company as a whole also, but on the quarterly basis, these are the pure simple numbers. Just to appraise the participants who are joining with these type of calls for the first time, we have primarily two type of business segments. One is medical devices and one is the bulk drugs or APIs, which are modernly called. So 80% of the revenue comes from medical devices and APIs. And API, of course, is our traditional business, our old business, which is our cash cow. And the company started from the API only. Medical devices is relatively new. When you say relatively new, it's still almost 20 years old now. But medical devices is the fastest growing \""

The management team includes Mr. Sushil Suri, Chairman and Managing Director, Mr. Ajay Kumar Sharma, Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Nishant Doshi, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, and Mr. Vipul Kumar Srivastava, Company Secretary and Compliance Officer. Mr. Suri starts with opening remarks, highlighting the outstanding performance of the company in the quarter and the year as a whole. He mentions the two primary business segments - medical devices and APIs, with 80% of revenue coming from these. APIs are the traditional business of the company, while medical devices are relatively new.'},\n",
       " 1: {'chunk_text': \"wo type of business segments. One is medical devices and one is the bulk drugs or APIs, which are modernly called. So 80% of the revenue comes from medical devices and APIs. And API, of course, is our traditional business, our old business, which is our cash cow. And the company started from the API only. Medical devices is relatively new. When you say relatively new, it's still almost 20 years old now. But medical devices is the fastest growing business in the company. Then back in 2015, 16, 16, 17, we have 500, 600 core company. Medical devices is only 13% of the revenue. But now medical devices is 26%, more than 26% of the revenue. This is growing much faster. The company in last seven years has grown with a CAGR of 16%. CAGR is CAGR, compounded annual growth rate. Company has grown at a CAGR of 16%. But medical devices has outsmart and grown at CAGR of 28% year on year. So that's why I'm saying it's the fastest growing segment within the modern thing. And medical devices, we are talking primarily of the home medical devices. We are into point-of-care medical devices. Point-of-care is used in hospitals also sometimes. You have some patient monitors and other things which are used on the bedside of the patient. But we are specialized in the home diagnostic. And we have built a beautiful brand, Dr. Morton, around customer service and around more consumer awareness, more one-on-one interaction with the customers. We sell our goods directly to over 3,000 distributors all over the country. And of course, network of more than 125,000 retailers. So we are a consumer company and a typical diagnostics company. And we are not into testing and other that stuff. We are a device. That's why we always call it devices. The second business, of course, is Bulgarian APIs, which is an established business, giving good cash flows and growing at its own good speed. Between these two, this is 80%. Then we have a range of formulations and OTP products, which is typical in any pharma company. But medical devices, that is our unique position. Moving specifically to the so-called key positioning of the company, the key achievements, what we have been able to do. In both medical devices, we have two leading products, BP monitor and glucose monitor. One is a glucose monitoring machine. And wherein you buy the meter, and then you buy the strip battery.

The company has established a strong brand presence with Dr. Morton, emphasizing customer service and consumer awareness. The company sells its products through a network of distributors and retailers across the country.

In-house means we are manufacturing it out of a factory. And we are manufacturing it for basic bare PCBs. And there's a full assembly line for that. I'll come to that later. And within API, we are category leaders in six APIs, six small products. So I don't want to confuse you with the name. But just to mention, these are Loratadine, Desloratadine, Montego Card. And there are three more products where we are third and fourth. So there are six products where we are market leaders. So all APIs are exported. Around 68% of our business in the API is from export. Hard currency, dollar export to advanced countries, regulated markets. And of course, the company has been consistently growing, both in top line and bottom line. With the help of the internal cash approval, the company has been able to clear all its old debts with all the banks. And in whatever structure we are, we are a debt-free company. It's negligible debt. When you say negligible debt, it means a simple car loan or other things. Rather, we have fixed deposits in the bank, which are sometimes used for an overdraft facility. So we are a debt-free company. So as we talk, we are celebrating the 40th year of our journey. And we proudly say that we have entered into this 40th year with more energy, more agility, and more performance-oriented approach. We are making more and more decisions in the company on how do we improve our performance and how do we better our prospects. That was a broad theme. Coming specifically to the operational performance, during this year, the revenue has grown by 20%. From 1,424 crores, we have grown to 1,704 crores. So almost 20%, 19.97%. 20% growth in the annual revenue. On a quarterly basis also, the revenue has grown 16.5% for the Q4. So consistently for the nine months also, there was an increase. And here as a whole, it's 20% increase. And just to update you that last year, the year was not so good.

So medical devices have grown by 35%. API business has grown by 14%. Some countries are still shying away. And of course, on the positive side, last couple of years, import prices, particularly from China, were disturbed. And rather, they were higher than expected. But now the import prices have also softened, and our margins have increased in the last three, four quarters. We're happy to announce. And of course, you can see in the base of it that the company's overall productivity and margins have gone up. A picture of the company, which is the earnings before interest depreciation, and of course, the taxation. So it has doubled, more than 101% increase from 85 crore in EBITDA last year. We have 173 crore, almost 173 crore in EBITDA, 172.6. And profit after tax also is 150% up. It's two and a half times, from 38 crores to almost 97 crores. So 39 crores to 97 crores, annual path has gone up. It's almost 150% increase. And as I shared that we are a debt-free company, so whatever is annual EBITDA, all we're seeing is the cash generation. So with 83 crore of these cash generation, this year we have 164 crores, 168 crores of cash generation, which is almost 100% up. So we are seeing that whatever the temporary blip was there in the last year, so we have covered quarter after quarter. It has taken a little longer than usual, but we are very comfortable with the margins profile now. So if we go specifically to the segment-wide, as I shared that our main lead segment, the fastest-growing segment is medical devices. So within medical devices, our DC monitor and gluco monitor are the two products. Gluco monitor, as per the industry report, we have 19%.

And of course, earlier, these were imported. And glucometers and BP monitor, both are manufactured from the bare PCBs. When you say bare PCBs, it means it's a plastic sheet. And after that, we do the mounting. There are sophisticated automatic machines, which are used to do the mounting of the registers and all that electronic parts of it. And facilities are not just temporary facilities. These are approved by International Date for Registers, or ISO 13485, which is the global standard for medical devices. And of course, as we speak, medical reservation guidelines are being tightened day and night, every month and month, and we are happy to see that small traders and small manufacturers start something and grow something. Over time, many people have come. So those things are going out. So we are happy that our facilities are better and controlled and approved by the International Presidency. Other than BP monitor and glucometers, we have thermometers, we have pregnancy kits, we have orthosupports, day scales, oximeters, stethoscopes. But all said and done, 95% of the revenue comes from glucometers and BP monitors. Glucomonitor is the main product. If we talk about total revenues, revenue last year was 327 crores, and this year it has touched 443 crores. So it's a 35% increase in the annual revenue of the medical devices. On a quarterly basis also, before it was lower than the last three quarters. Even in the slower quarters, there's a 28% increase in the annual revenue of this division. And on a quarter-on-quarter basis, there's a 28% jump and 35% over there. And as we have entered already the Q1 of the next year, we are already facing shortages of the products and capacity constraints because the demand has picked up and the pace is to be maintained. So we are trying to do more and more backward integration and control the supply chain. The 35% increase in one year doesn't mean that it is a peak.

Coming specifically to the glucometers that I shared, that the maximum business within this trade, out of 447 crores, 342 crores is coming from glucometers and the street fields. Here I would like to share with all the participants that the way this model is working is that this is more like, you know, that printer cartridge model. We have to first sell the meters, and then after that we continue selling the strips. So here the more and more meters we sell in the market, so more and more strip customers we are generating. So we keep investing behind the meters, and we create start-ups. We keep creating new and new customers. Over a period of last 10 years, more so in the last 4-5 years, we have been able to install 1.16 crores, 11.6 million meters in the market. So that is like our customer base. We have a customer base of 11.6 million meters, which is 1.16 crores. And on those meters, we can use regularly and repeat buying. It's more like insurance. It's more like a regular income. And we sell 36 crore strips. Last year we sold 36 crore strips on the basis of this 1.16 crore meters. So already in the market. The number of meters sold has more than doubled in the last 3 years. And similarly, the number of strips sold has also doubled in the last 3 years. So the more meters we install, the more strips we keep on selling, and that is the business model. We keep investing and keep reaping the harvest also. As we are talking, by end of March this year, we have sold more than 1.5 million strips, which is almost 150 crores more than the population of India. But that's a cumulative number. That's just a statistic. But on an average, we sell 35 crore strips. And this year we are expecting maybe to go up to 40 crore strips, maybe more. So the whole idea here is to acquire a customer, keep the customer happy and satisfied. So we have a full service team available all over the country. There are company-owned service centers. And all the retainers and our sales team also, they double up as sales reps. And we provide a lifetime of free replacement of the meters in case there is any problem, no questions asked, because we are here for the customer service.

And we provide a lifetime of free replacement of the meters in case there is any problem, no questions asked, because we are here for the customer service. And going ahead, the way the world is changing, so any company who has more or better relation or contact with the customer, he will be giving. So that is the way we have created this consumer brand. That's what the whole philosophy and ideology of Dr. Morton is, that we create long-term relationships with the customer. And Glucomonitor is one of the examples. That once you have a meter, that every day, every time, whenever you are checking your sugar levels, you would always keep in mind. And once you are a customer for Glucomonitor, then it is easy and comfortable buying another product from the same company. So most of the time, the customer is the same. The guy who has sugar problem, they have BP problem also, or vice versa. So it's the same customers, so BP monitor and Glucomonitor. So it's a very interesting business model. And we don't have to look out for new customers. And to the same customers, same set of retailers, same family. Maybe within one family, one problem, one person has sugar problem, second person has BP problem. But after a certain age, it goes together. So coming specifically to the BP monitors. BP monitors is a very simple model. Unlike there, we have to send strips also. Here we sell directly the meter. So of course, there is no further revenue here. So here also, the business has grown 36% this year. While the number of meters sold has gone 29%, from 8 lakh meters to 10 lakh meters, 10.5 lakh meters. So we sell almost 1 lakh meter every month. We will take some season off season. So we have cost 1 million mark second time. During COVID also, we have sold more than 1 million meters. But earlier at that time, it was being imported. Now we have produced in-house 1 million meters and sold 100% from in-house capacity. So of course, we are adding more and more SMT lines and more and more dedicated lines to produce more meters. And we hope that this business also will keep on growing at a similar pace. This year, of course, it has grown 36%, because last year numbers were a bit slower.

There is still a challenge that this mill is not very high and lucrative as super monitors, because there are two components, the consumable and the strip. But here, yes, we are basically capitalizing on the docu-market brand and giving a better service to the consumers. So when we talk of the manufacturing lines, as I shared that we are manufacturing all the meters from their PCBs and the PCBs are first mounted to their printing machines and there are SMT lines and there are injection molding lines, which is why we can basically produce those sidebars, front, back. And of course, there are separate printing machines for the LEDs, so LEDs are prepared separately. Then there are multiple tests. And in the strips, then there are the bulk strips, which we are still importing from Korea. And sheet cutting is happening in India. But to have a longer-term supply contract and to have a longer-term control over our supply chain, we are planning to have a, not planning, we are working to have an in-house production of the strips also. So, of course, we are working with our Korean counterparts to have the technology here and have a controlled manufacturing setup in India. Hopefully, once we have that, we move in some business from Korea also to India. But even if we do not get any regular business from them, but if we have the strip manufacturing in-house, we have the complete meter manufacturing in-house, starting from their PCBs, including all the moving parts and including the screen printing, then we have a full supply chain for the BP monitors and glucose monitors, both. And we can work on the export also. As of today, we are exporting small quantities under Dr. Morton brand in Thailand and Middle East. So, of course, Nepal, Bhutan were launched much earlier. But still, export is miniscule. But as we go forward, so we see that in case we have a full backup and we have full capacity, so we can start exporting to, I would say, markets like US and Europe, every single chain can be as big as our complete India market.

And even if we get one single order for one year, we should be happy to double up our capacity or maybe three times. So, we see a lot of opportunities. And thankfully, this line is still very technical, very sensitive, and not many organic sales are there. So, most of the supplies have been imported. And government is trying to control those unregulated means where people are trying to, for sake of better word, people are trying to smuggle up things and trying to just supply things in the market without any service, without any backup. So, imports are becoming more and more difficult. And even the bare CCGs have been recently brought under the anti-dumping duties. So, we are thankful to government that government is putting more and more efforts to cut down on the imports. The more control on the imports is there, more and more people will be encouraged to have Indian production. And that will save us a lot of the costly exchange also. And of course, the overall cost cutting in supply chain. Because COVID time, everybody has seen that irrespective of the cost, so China was acting crazy, they had increased prices 30%, 40%, 50%, and they were playing balls even on the freight containers which was there. So, we are trying to have the same thing in-house. It is in line with Honorable Prime Minister Modi's decision that we should be the hub, we should be the manufacturer, and we should not be a buyer. We don't want to be just another person. So, we are happy we are on the same side. So, going forward with the particular devices business, like I said that we are confident of maintaining a similar flow pattern. So, we have noted down in our presentation that what would be the growth drivers. So, the number one growth driver, of course, would be capacity extension because now it's the manufacturing, we have to produce whatever thing we are talking.

So, as of today, we are more focused on north, on north and north-west. But going forward, south is one area where we need to make more efforts and we will double up the sales there also. It's a much bigger and much educated market, but we have not been able to invest behind that market. So, that's another area within India. Then, second, as I shared that there will be direct exports by under-company labels and a private label also. So, which is a slow process, but it's a much bigger opportunity than doing little exports under our own brand. Then, of course, we are expanding the sales team for India also, for export also. Retail coverage is what we need to be focusing more because it's a service-oriented product. So, we need to be present closer to the customers so that the retailers get the comfort and the buyers get the comfort. And, of course, more and more sales training and more and more approaches so that the sales team has a better productivity. So, these are, I would say, for both drivers where we see new sales coming up. Coming specifically to the new initiative, other than gluco-molecular and gluco-molecular, there are multiple products that we are working, whether it is immunodigestive state, cell culture, and, of course, some other industrial and mechanical products. But major here is the continuous glucose monitoring, CPM, where you get a patch on your shoulder and you take readings on the phone. We are working on these, but, I think, little away from what we are teaching. So, this industry is very fragile in terms of technology and other things.

So, talking of the percentage here of the revenue, Montelukas has been getting 27% share, Loratarin and Desloratarin, similar products, taking together around 23%. Atorvastatin is 17% market share.

And if the market goes up, certainly the revenues will multiply much faster. But on the other hand, we are exhausting our capacities, and we have to keep investing in the capacities. So that's why we are always under the pressure of expansion because we didn't have any major expansion in the last 20, 25 years. All the expansion is happening only from internal approvals. And another interesting thing which I want to share with you is that during this financial year, we had a new product, Faxoprene, a new in the basket of these so-called blockbusters. We had this product, but there was not much revenue coming. We got U.S. FDA approval back in 22 here for this product, Faxoprene.

Out of three inspections in two plants, we had no observation by the FDA, and we have a metric of mill observation. And not that we are perfect, but as compared to the industry standard in general, APIs do not attract many this thing because our product history is a B2B. But as it is to other peers in the formulation industry, the magazine hasn't been very friendly. So we hope to maintain these standards, and we are happy that the team has been working very nicely. So that's all about the basic, I would say, both businesses we have talked, medical devices and API. Other than this, we have formulation and OTC. And in OTC, you all know that we have a very popular product, Bernol. So it's more than 75 years of legacy. We have purchased this plant from Racket Kit Pyramid. And of course, before that, it was owned by Nol Pharma. It's an international brand. And now it has – it's a synonym with burn. More important than burn, it's a synonym with Janan, rather. Jalega to Bernol is Jalega. So it's a very popular brand. And of course, we have a separate distribution more for OTC and formulations. So we are expanding that also.

You see, let me share with you that our distribution business, it is very small. So, it is around 45 crores this year, but we have incurred losses into this because our team is small and we are not able to really achieve the break-even in the formulation. So, that is one. Then we have manufacturing. We have done capacity addition only this financial year. So, our salary cost was too high. So, we must see this turnaround in this financial year. So, whatever this negative has really brought down our overall EBITDA. So, that at least this financial year should be break-even. And the formulation distribution business, we have losses.

The analysts raised concerns about the company's margins, which were at 11% in the quarter, lower than industry standards. The management attributed this to losses in their distribution business and high salary costs due to capacity additions. They expressed confidence in turning around these aspects in the current financial year to achieve break-even or improved margins. The discussion also touched upon the company's distribution channels, with online sales accounting for around 10% and the rest through general trade. Competition in the market was highlighted, with multinational players like Roche and Omran being mentioned, where the company positioned itself as ahead in terms of ground presence and performance. There were also speculations about Roche facing challenges and potential changes in their strategy due to increasing market competition and customer demands.\"},\n",

Other than this, there are small, long tail of those so-called import and sell companies, which because they fly by night, they come and go. Okay. And this is a doctor prescribed product or this is an OTC? It is pure OTC. It is pure OTC. I understand. Thank you so much for answering. I have something on the margins. Yeah, sorry. I have something on the margins. So, I think like I explained that we are still struggling to find a headway in the formulation, but you would understand that as I shared in the beginning, 80% of revenue is between medical devices and API. So, honestly, that's our growth story and that is where we want to go. Formulation and OTC, we are, I would say, not on the runway. And we are just trying to see, okay, how can we make this business profitable and maybe at some stage divest it or get a partner or get into a separate company. By that, both these businesses are into separate companies now. Dr. Maltin is a separate subsidiary. Formulation is a separate subsidiary. So, obviously, we are working to at least these businesses breakeven and we lose, we don't have a drag on the profitability. But on the other hand, certainly there's, even after corporate allocation, our overall beta is lower. But in devices, for example, I was telling that this is a printer cartridge model. The more printers we sell, the more cartridges we will be selling. So, more meters installed. So, the number of meters installed will also grow very smoothly. For example, 20 lakh meters, 25 lakhs, 30 lakhs. But number of sticks will keep on increasing because for every meter we have installed. So, that delta is increasing every time. So, the margins are increasing. So, we try to accelerate these numbers for the next five years. And we are seeing that devices margins will go up to 80, 90 percent. Because that's how the math works. So, similarly, if... Just to ask you on this point, which you mentioned, a small question. This 400 crore sale that we have closed for devices this year, out of that 400 crore, how much sale comes from these strips? Around 373 crore strips only, meters and strips. \",\n",

What is the absolute quantum of the strip business that you have per year? I think you have separate numbers. I don't have, but it is around 85 percent is a strip business. Around 85 percent is strip? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I would think that your margins in strip are substantially higher than your meter. Yes, sir. Basically, that is where we do not officially share the so-called separate numbers because meter is sold at a certain MRP, then there are strips. Of course, there are certain schemes which are shared with the distributors, but the ultimate objective is that, okay, we sell more and more strips. I understand. The strips are, of course, a high-profit number, and as we go forward, the meter would be growing at, say, 20 percent. Strip business will grow at 30 percent. That 10 percent is pure profit. Okay. During COVID time, for example, there was a shortage. New meters are not being installed. So, we had a margin of 21 percent that year because meter installment installation is ongoing. Strip users have gone high. You are checking, everybody is checking this sugar level three times, four times. So, strip usage goes up and awareness is going up. So, this is going to up that. Okay.

So, what percentage of your API business is out of these six molecules? As I shared, around 90 percent of the business comes from these six molecules, and in 10 percent, we certainly have a long tail, but within that 10 percent also, there are five, six main products. For example, loratadine, lestoratadine, montelicose, rosuvastatin, taxofenadine. These are six products, which is, I would say, we call it key products. And then there is a dapagliflozin, linagliflozin, linagliptin, onnifartin, epixaban, enoxaban, faxaniliptin. But these are all new molecules under patent in one country or the other, so they take some time. Okay. Okay. And any of these molecules you think can become big, other than these six? Actually, at Peshawar, we all plan that everything should become big, but markets are real. So, sometimes, for example, thetagliptin was expected to be a blockbuster, but 20-30 people launched in the market, so product bombed. Sometimes, innovators played some games. So, we are aggressive in everything, but it depends on the market. You have a relationship, and you mentioned Perigo, which is a very big player. It becomes easier to penetrate the market, right? Otherwise, pharma manufacturing… Perigo gave me the example of taxofenadine, since we have a relationship with Perigo and loratadine, so, and it's an OTC company. They are a private-table company. So, they picked up taxofenadine also. So, even though taxofenadine… It all depends which market opens at what time. The last couple of years, particularly Europe's supplies and Europe's approvals have been disturbed. Of course, Europe was disturbed post-COVID.

So, this will be from our own manufacturing of the strips, or is there an effort to achieve this kind of margining in the segment? This will be 100% out of our own manufacturing, and that is our key strategy that we do not import, and we do not even do a lot of outsourcing also. The machines are not very costly. The only thing that needs is a space and a building. So, we are building huge sheds to accommodate our injection molding and other machines. So, we are trying to reduce our dependence on import and reduce our dependence on the third-party manufacturers who order us every day. So, we are trying to get better controls. Okay. And so, since you have a fair idea that Roche is winding down its retail business, so are there any plans to just sell the strips that can go into the Roche machine and take that business away from those guys? These machines, Madhu, are very locked machines. So, Roche machine cannot use my strips, and my meter cannot use their strips. So, these are customized meters and customized strips. So, they work with a particular software. I am calling it a printer carting model or a Gillette shaving razor model. So, we cannot use anybody else's thing. But on the other hand, the advantage is in case one player goes out of the market, or even if it is a temporary disturbance, so that's an opportunity to capture the market. We can sell our meters, and we can gain that market. So, that's an advantage. But we can't use their customer base. And Roche has been there in the market for 20 years. Maybe they are there for the last 15 years. We don't know. So, maybe they have a similar meter base. But regular meters, active users, we have more active users than that. Okay, got it. Sir, just a final question. Can we see our formulation business being at least breakeven on F525? Yes, yes. It is on the cart. That's how we are working on it.

Sir, just on the medical devices, apart from… First of all, on glucometer itself, if you could share, you know, what are the new developments in terms of product side which can give an edge compared to competitors for us? Yes, Tushar. Glucometer, as I shared, it's a very stable and robust product. And we sometimes do not disturb even the model that we launch. For example, the VG03 model which we sell to the trade and the VG05 for online. So basically, the customer is used to a particular technology and this technology is successful and is working. But as we go forward, there may be some improvements within the models with some electronic components, some screen components, which we also keep on doing. There's a Bluetooth possibility, but we have tried Bluetooth operations also, but people are not ready to pay 200 rupees extra for Bluetooth because not many people are used to it. Normally, these devices are used by senior citizens. So, but the interesting development here is, as I shared earlier, was the continuous glucose monitoring, the CGM, the patch technology. So, our R&D team is working on the patch and we are trying to develop our own patch. The existing product in the market, Abbott has a product that is very costly. They charge 14,000 rupees for a 14-day patch. So, now many apps have come there, they give it a discounted rate. Even then, it costs at least 5,000 rupees for one patch for 14 days. And we have two patches for a month. It's like 10,000 rupees a month cost just to test your sugar. So, I would say India is a poor country, so we can't afford that. There may be a certain half percent, one percent people who can afford that. But for the masses, we are trying to bring down the cost to maybe, say, 1,000 rupees per – 1,000 rupees monthly cost or 1,000 rupees per patch. So, but that's a long dream. It may take two to three years' time. But other than meter and glucometer and BP monitor, what we are working on is the technology. For example, strip manufacturing.

Once we understand the strip manufacturing, then we are basically trying to learn the art of making a strip. That humble strip has got a circuit, it has got a biochemistry, it has got enzymes. So, once we know how to make a strip, today we are making a strip for glucometer, for the sugar testing. Tomorrow, we have to make a strip for cholesterol testing. So, we can make a strip for the cholesterol testing also. Similarly, we developed technologies for very accurate pregnancy tests last year.

Look, as I shared that, that number is almost, I would say, going steady, not that it is constant. From 22 crores to 22 lakh meters, this year it was 24 lakh meters. So, next year, maybe 30 lakh meters. So, naturally, that's, I would say, this control which we have, we always know that, okay, which market is lacking. If, naturally, we are launching a new market, we have to give more meters. And if we are in the same market, we know what is the absorption level. We never keep high inventory in the market. So, on the other hand, we always see that, okay, if we have sold so many meters, is the strip sale coming or not? There may be some markets, you place meters, the strips, people don't come back. So, people don't use. So, maybe some markets have more, I would say, strip sales, some markets have lower. But on average, the whole idea is that we keep on growing the meters. So, this year we have planned for 30 lakh meters. And, of course, next will be 30, 36 lakhs, 40 lakhs. So, keep\",\n",

They mention that the estimated market size for diabetics in India is 100 million, with an assumed addressable market of 50%, which is 5 crore meters. Currently, the company is at 1 crore meters and aims to reach 2 crore meters with a 27% growth rate in three years. They express confidence in the expanding market due to increasing awareness, reach, affordability, and health concerns, especially post-COVID. The management anticipates continued growth opportunities in the Indian market and hints at global expansion possibilities.

And, of course, we watch the endgame, the rule here, I would say, the formula here is how many strips do we sell per meter? So, as of date, it is around 150 strips per meter sold. If we sell 25 lakh, 24 lakh meters, so we have sold 36 crore strips. So, this 150 number should go up. Because the usage should go up. 150 becomes 155. So, that is also an indicator. During COVID time, it was 155. Because the usage was very high. So, this number, so long as my number goes up, according to the current year number, we are not calculating on an average basis. Because even if we say 1 crore meters, active meters may be 20 percent or 30 percent. We don't know. So, based on that number, our usage is much higher. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I know it is a new business, a new game, so little more questions, but interesting. Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of question and answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments. Yes. Thank you very much for the patient hearing and I appreciate some interesting, insightful questions. And I would like to only add that it is just the beginning of the story. So, India's story is unfolding very nicely globally. So, we are a traditional, hardcore manufacturing company and we want to focus on more and more in building new technologies and more basis of quality, FDA, ISO. So, robust manufacturing model based on low cost and a global capacity. So, that is our model. And of course, with more and more contact and relationship with the consumers, both in the medical devices and the API side. Happy to have any questions.
