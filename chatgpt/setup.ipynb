       "b'Title: Create a Flask Application With Google Login\\n\\nURL Source: https://realpython.com/flask-google-login/\\n\\nPublished Time: 2019-07-17T14:00:00+00:00\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\nWatch Now This tutorial has a related video course created by the Real Python team. Watch it together with the written tutorial to deepen your understanding: [**Using Google Login With Flask**](https://realpython.com/courses/using-google-login-flask/)\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably seen the option for _Google Login_ on various websites. Some sites also have more options like _Facebook Login_ or _GitHub Login_. All these options allow users to utilize existing accounts to use a new service.\\n\\nIn this article, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll work through the creation of a [Flask](https://realpython.com/tutorials/flask/) web application. Your application will allow a user to log in using their Google identity instead of creating a new account. There are tons of benefits with this method of user management. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be safer and simpler than managing the traditional username and password combinations.\\n\\nThis article will be more straightforward if you already understand the [basics of Python](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python3-introduction/). It would also help to know a bit about web frameworks and HTTP requests, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not strictly necessary.\\n\\n**By the end of this article, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to:**\\n\\n*   Create a Flask web application that lets users log in with Google\\n*   Create client credentials to interact with Google\\n*   Use Flask-Login for user session management in a Flask application\\n*   Better understand OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC)\\n\\nYou can click the box below to get the code for the application you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make in this article:\\n\\nWhy Use Google Login for Your Users?[](#why-use-google-login-for-your-users \"Permanent link\")\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou may want individual users to have profiles. Or perhaps you want to provide features to only certain users. In any case, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to know who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interacting with your application. In other words, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to authenticate users and identify them in some unique way.\\n\\nThe traditional solution is to use a unique username and a secret password. Your application would store that information and ask for it when needed. However, there are a few downsides to that solution:\\n\\n*   You have to securely manage the passwords.\\n*   You have to implement any account-related functionality:\\n    *   Two-factor authentication\\n    *   Password reset\\n*   You have to protect against malicious login attempts.\\n*   Your users have to remember yet another username and password.\\n\\nBy using Google login for your users, you push all that responsibility to them. Your application waits for the user to go through authentication. Google then tells your application about that user. At that point, you can effectively log them into your application.\\n\\nYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to store any passwords, and Google handles all the security.\\n\\nHow Applications Use Google Login[](#how-applications-use-google-login \"Permanent link\")\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThere are two very popular and important specifications called [OAuth 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). OIDC is built on top of OAuth 2, adding a few new ideas and concepts.\\n\\nThese specifications define how a third-party application can obtain information from another service. This usually involves obtaining consent from a user. To unpack this a bit, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at how this applies to the application you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re about to build.\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re about to write a third-party application, and it will let a user use a _Google Login_ button to log in. To do that, Google needs to know about your application. Luckily, you can register your application as a client to Google.\\n\\nOnce a user comes to your application and presses the _Google Login_ button, you can send them to Google. From there, Google needs to make sure that the user consents to pass along their email and other information to your application. Should the user consent, Google sends back some information to your application. You then store that information and can reference it later, effectively logging the user in.\\n\\nOpenID Connect Details[](#openid-connect-details \"Permanent link\")\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo request information on behalf of a user, you must become a `client` to the authentication server, also known as the provider. The first thing you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll realize if you dig into these specifications is that there are a lot of overlapping terms and concepts.\\n\\nSo as a third-party application (also known as a client), you want to get info from the provider on the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behalf. There are a series of steps that enable that to happen, and those steps must happen in a specific order. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll sometimes hear OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect referred to as a **handshake**, **flow**, or **dance**.\\n\\nThose steps are, broadly:\\n\\n1.  You register a third-party application as a client to the provider:\\n    *   You receive unique client credentials from the provider.\\n    *   You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use these client credentials to authenticate (prove who you are) to the provider later on.\\n2.  The client sends a request to the provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s `authorization` URL\\n3.  The provider asks the user to authenticate (prove who they are)\\n4.  The provider asks the user to consent to the client acting on their behalf:\\n    *   Usually this includes limited access, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made clear to the user what the client is asking for.\\n    *   This is like when you have to approve an app on your phone to have access to location or contacts.\\n5.  The provider sends the client a unique authorization code.\\n6.  The client sends the authorization code back to the Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s `token` URL.\\n7.  The provider sends the client tokens to use with other provider URLs on behalf of the user.\\n\\nThose steps include both of the standards mentioned so far. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of OAuth 2, adding a few additional features and requirements, mostly involving the process of authentication. Other than the authentication mentioned in the flow above, the important OIDC concepts for your application are the **provider configuration** and **userinfo endpoint**.\\n\\nThe **provider configuration** contains information about the provider, including the exact URLs you need to use for the OAuth 2 flow. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a standard URL on an OIDC provider you can use to get back a document with [standardized fields](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata).\\n\\nThe **[userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)** will return information about the user after you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone through the OAuth 2 flow. This will include their email and some basic profile information you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use in your application. In order to obtain this user information, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need a token from the provider, as described in the last step in the flow above.\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see the details about how the provider configuration and user info endpoint can be utilized later on.\\n\\nCreating a Google Client[](#creating-a-google-client \"Permanent link\")\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe first step to enable a _Google Login_ option is to register your application as a client to Google. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk through the steps to do that.\\n\\nFirst, note that you will need a Google Account. You already have one if you use Gmail.\\n\\nNext, go to the [Google developers credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).\\n\\nOnce in, you may be prompted to agree to their terms of service. Should you agree to those, press the _Create credentials_ button on the next page. Select the option for **OAuth client ID**:\\n\\n[![Image 1: Google create credentials screen shot](https://files.realpython.com/media/client_id.8c970f445c4f.png)](https://files.realpython.com/media/client_id.8c970f445c4f.png)\\n\\nSelect the `Web application` option at the top. You can provide a name for the client in the `Name` field as well. The name you provide will be displayed to users when they are consenting to your application acting on their behalf.\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be running your web application locally for now, so you can set the `Authorized JavaScript origins` to `https://127.0.0.1:5000` and `Authorized redirect URIs` to `https://127.0.0.1:5000/login/callback`. This will allow your local Flask application to communicate with Google.\\n\\nFinally, hit `Create` and take note of the `client ID` and `client secret`. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need both later.\\n\\nCreating Your Own Web Application[](#creating-your-own-web-application \"Permanent link\")\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow for the fun part where you apply the knowledge you learned to create an actual web application!\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start with the goal in mind. You want to create an application that lets users log in with their Google account. That application should be able to retrieve some basic information about the user from Google, like their email address. Then the application should store basic user information in a database.\\n\\nFirst, though, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at the framework and libraries you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be using.\\n\\n### Flask[](#flask \"Permanent link\")\\n\\n[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight web-framework, a self-proclaimed **microframework**. It comes with built-in tools for the basic tasks that a web application will perform, like routing URLs and handling HTTP requests.\\n\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve chosen to use Flask as an example for both its popularity and simplicity. However, the things you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned about OAuth 2 and OIDC are not specific to Flask. In fact, even the library you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be using to make OAuth 2 and OIDC easier is usable in any Python code. In other words, with some minor modifications, you can take what you learn here and apply it to another framework of your choice.\\n\\n### Flask-Login[](#flask-login \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nAnother tool you can use to make the handling of users easier is [flask\\\\_login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which provides **user session management**.\\n\\nThis library does a few things behind the scenes and gives you some tools to help with users. Namely, it provides utilities for you to know when a user is logged in and logged out. It does this by managing a user session inside a browser cookie.\\n\\nIt also handles the logging in and logging out of users, including the creation of database entries for those users. From the aspect of your code though, it really just makes everything a lot simpler (which you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see soon).\\n\\n### OAuthLib[](#oauthlib \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a common phrase that holds very true for security-related and standard-compliant code: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reinvent the wheel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOAuth 2 and OpenID Connect standards are complicated. Have a look at the RFC and specifications, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dense. One mistake means that you could be opening up a vulnerability in your application.\\n\\nSo, you are not going to be writing code to implement these standards. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to use a Python package that was chosen on some very specific criteria:\\n\\n1.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a popular and generally recommended library. Lots of other packages use this library internally.\\n2.  It is very active, with people patching bugs frequently.\\n3.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s battle-hardened and has been around since 2012.\\n\\nThere are web-framework-specific packages that use this library to more closely integrate into Flask, Django, Pyramid, and others. However, to keep the code you learn here framework-agnostic, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use this library directly without any fancy wrappers.\\n\\n### Installing Dependencies[](#installing-dependencies \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nThere are a number of third-party [dependencies](https://realpython.com/courses/managing-python-dependencies/) that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use to make your life easier. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a summary of those dependencies:\\n\\n*   A web framework to make typical web application tasks easier (Flask)\\n*   A headache-free way of managing user sessions (Flask-Login)\\n*   A battle-hardened OIDC library (`oauthlib`)\\n\\nAdditionally, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use the following:\\n\\n*   A database to store some information about users who log in ([SQLite](https://realpython.com/python-sqlite-sqlalchemy/)\\n*   An user-friendly way to send HTTP requests to Google (`requests`)\\n*   A quick way to enable running securely with `https` locally (pyOpenSSL)\\n\\nSQLite is part of the standard Python library, but the other packages are not. So you have a couple of dependencies to install. For now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just go through the creation of this application step by step.\\n\\nFirst, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to install those third-party dependencies mentioned above. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do this by creating a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:\\n\\nNext, you can install those dependencies using `pip`, Python\\xe2\\x80\\x99s package installer.\\n\\nTo install from the `requirements.txt` file, run the following command in your terminal:\\n\\nNow you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready to rock and roll! Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dig right into the code.\\n\\n### Imports, Configuration, and Setup[](#imports-configuration-and-setup \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nStart by adding a few files to support some basic database functionality and user management. These won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be described section by section, mostly because diving into [Python database](https://realpython.com/tutorials/databases/) implementation details is a rabbit hole that would distract us from our goal.\\n\\nThis file will handle some database functionality. This is almost line by line from [Flask\\xe2\\x80\\x99s official database tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/database/):\\n\\nNow that you have some database utilities, you can start to think about the schema. You may notice that this code is looking for a `schema.sql` file, which you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll create next.\\n\\nThe `schema.sql` file is just some SQL that will create a user table in our database. You can see the fields you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be storing per user in this file.\\n\\nHere you have a single table, `user`, which will house a few things related to users (their name, the email they log in with, and their profile picture from Google):\\n\\nThe code in the `db.py` file will actually execute this SQL to create the table in your database.\\n\\nThis next file contains our `User` class, which will store and retrieve information from the database. The name, email, and profile picture will all be retrieved from Google, which you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see later on in the article.\\n\\nThe `User` class has methods to get an existing user from the database and create a new user:\\n\\nThe code executes SQL statements against the database, which is retrieved from the `get_db()` function from the previous `db.py` file. Each new user results in the insertion of an additional row in the database.\\n\\nAfter you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve created the `db.py`, `schema.sql`, and `user.py` files from the above code, you can create a new `app.py` file. Add to it the following imports:\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use all these later on, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so important to understand each of them at the moment. The next portion in your `app.py` is some configuration:\\n\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll store the Google Client ID and Client Secret, which you should have created earlier in the article. These will be used later in the OIDC flow.\\n\\nYour application will try to get the client credentials by reading environmental variables. There are a couple reasons for this:\\n\\n1.  You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to change your code later if you want to use different credentials, you just have to update the environment.\\n2.  You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accidentally commit your secret credentials to [GitHub](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/) (or another public repository).\\n\\nLots of people accidentally commit secrets to public repositories, posing a pretty serious security risk. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better to protect against that by using environmental variables.\\n\\nAlternatively, you _could_ paste the strings directly here and store them in these variables. **However**, the client secret should **not** be shared or committed to any public repository. In other words, be very careful not to check in this file if you paste your real client credentials in here.\\n\\nFinally, below is some code with global variables and some naive database initialization logic. Most of this, other than the database initialization, is the standard way to set up Flask, Flask-Login, and OAuthLib, which you read about earlier:\\n\\nNote that you are already using the Client ID from Google to initialize our `oauthlib` client in the `WebApplicationClient`.\\n\\nYou can create another environment variable `SECRET_KEY` that [Flask and Flask-Login will use](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#flask.Flask.secret_key) to cryptographically sign cookies and other items.\\n\\n### Web Application Endpoints[](#web-application-endpoints \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nNow, for the fun stuff. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to write four endpoints for your web application:\\n\\n1.  One for the homepage\\n2.  One for beginning the user login process\\n3.  One for a callback where Google will redirect to after a user logs in\\n4.  One for logging out\\n\\nThese endpoints will be defined by different URLs on your application with very creative names:\\n\\n1.  **Homepage:** `/`\\n2.  **Login:** `/login`\\n3.  **Login Callback:** `/login/callback`\\n4.  **Logout:** `/logout`\\n\\nOf course, you may want to add additional pages and functionality later. The end result of this application will be totally extensible to add anything you want to it.\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll add all the following code for these endpoints into the `app.py` file. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a look at each of these endpoints\\xe2\\x80\\x99 code, one at a time.\\n\\n#### Homepage[](#homepage \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nThis is nothing fancy visually, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll add some neat logic to display something different if a user is logged in. When they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not logged in, a link will appear that says _Google Login_.\\n\\nPressing the link will redirect them to your `/login` endpoint, which will initiate the login flow. After a successful login, the homepage will now display both the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Google email and their public Google profile picture!\\n\\nWithout further ado, you can start adding more code to your `app.py` file:\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll note that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re returning HTML as a string, which Flask will be able to serve. The `current_user.is_authenticated` is a lovely addition of the `Flask-Login` library. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a straightforward way to determine if the current user interacting with your application is logged in or not. This lets you apply conditional logic. In this case, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s displaying some information you have saved about the user if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re logged in.\\n\\nYou can get fields from your database entry for the user by just accessing them as attributes on the `current_user` object, such as `current_user.email`. This is another addition of `Flask-Login`.\\n\\n#### Login[](#login \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nNow let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get to the OAuth 2 flow. The _Google Login_ button from above will redirect to this endpoint. The first step in the flow is to figure out where Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OAuth 2 Authorization endpoint is.\\n\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where the lines between what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defined by OAuth 2 and by OpenID Connect (OIDC) start to blur. As discussed previously, OIDC has a standard endpoint for a **provider configuration**, which contains a bunch of OAuth 2 and OIDC information. The document with that information is served from a standard endpoint everywhere, `.well-known/openid-configuration`.\\n\\nAssuming you copied the previous code that defined `GOOGLE_DISCOVERY_URL`, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a quick, naive, function for retrieving Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provider configuration:\\n\\nThe field from the provider configuration document you need is called `authorization_endpoint`. This will contain the URL you need to use to initiate the OAuth 2 flow with Google from your client application.\\n\\nYou can put all that logic together with the following code:\\n\\nLuckily, `oauthlib` makes the actual request to Google easier. You used your pre-configured `client` that you already gave your Google Client ID to. Next, you provided the redirect you want Google to use. Finally, you asked Google for a number of OAuth 2 `scopes`.\\n\\nYou can think of each scope as a separate piece of user information. In your case, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking for the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s email and basic profile information from Google. The user will, of course, have to consent to give you this information.\\n\\n#### Login Callback[](#login-callback \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do this one in pieces, since it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit more involved than the previous few endpoints.\\n\\nOnce you redirect to Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authorization endpoint, a lot happens on Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end.\\n\\nThe login endpoint on your application is the jumping point for all of Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work authenticating the user and asking for consent. Once the user logs in with Google and agrees to share their email and basic profile information with your application, Google generates a unique code that it sends back to your application.\\n\\nAs a reminder, here are the OIDC steps you read about earlier:\\n\\n1.  You register a third-party application as a client to the provider.\\n2.  The client sends a request to the provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s `authorization` URL.\\n3.  The provider asks the user to authenticate (prove who they are).\\n4.  The provider asks the user to consent to the client acting on their behalf.\\n5.  The provider sends the client a unique authorization code\\n6.  The client sends the authorization code back to the provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s `token` URL\\n7.  The provider sends the client tokens to use with other URLs on behalf of the user\\n\\nWhen Google sends back that unique code, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be sending it to this login callback endpoint on your application. So your first step is to define the endpoint and get that `code`:\\n\\nThe next thing you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do is send that code back to Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s `token` endpoint. After Google verifies your client credentials, they will send you back tokens that will allow you to authenticate to other Google endpoints on behalf of the user, including the `userinfo` endpoint you read about earlier. In your case, you only asked to view basic profile information, so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only thing you can do with the tokens.\\n\\nTo start with, you need to figure out what Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s `token` endpoint is. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use the provider configuration document again:\\n\\n`oauthlib` comes to your rescue a few times in this next block of code. First, you need to construct the token request. Once the request is constructed, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use the `requests` library to actually send it out. Then `oauthlib`, once again, will help you with parsing the tokens from the response:\\n\\nNow that you have the necessary tools to get the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profile information, you need to ask Google for it. Luckily, OIDC defines a user information endpoint, and its URL for a given provider is standardized in the provider configuration. You can get the location by checking the `userinfo_endpoint` field in the provider configuration document. Then you can use `oauthlib` to add the token to your request and use `requests` to send it out:\\n\\nThe next step in your journey is to parse the response from the `userinfo` endpoint. Google uses an optional field, `email_verified`, to confirm that not only has the user created an account, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve verified the email address to complete the account creation. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generally safe to conditionally check for this verification, as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another layer of security that Google offers.\\n\\nThat being said, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll check for that, and if Google says the user is verified, then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll parse their information. The 4 pieces of basic profile information you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use are:\\n\\n1.  **`sub`:** the subject, a unique identifier for the user in Google\\n2.  **`email`:** the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Google email address\\n3.  **`picture`:** the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public profile picture in Google\\n4.  **`given_name`:** the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first and last name in Google\\n\\nAll of that parsing results in the following code:\\n\\nThe final steps in this callback are:\\n\\n1.  Create a user in your database with the information you just got from Google\\n2.  Begin a user session by logging that user in\\n3.  Send user back to the homepage (where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll now display their public profile information)\\n\\nThe code to fulfill those steps is as follows:\\n\\nSo what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing here is creating a new row in your database for the user if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already exist. Then, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting a session using Flask-Login.\\n\\n#### Logout[](#logout \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nThe logout endpoint is much less code than the last few endpoints. You just call a logout function and redirect back to the homepage. Done and done. Here it is:\\n\\nThe `@login_required` [decorator](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) is something important to mention here. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another tool from the `Flask-Login` toolbox and will make sure that only logged in users can access this endpoint. You can use this if only logged in users should be accessing something. In this case, only logged in users can log out.\\n\\n### Testing Your Application Locally[](#testing-your-application-locally \"Permanent link\")\\n\\nYou can run your Flask application on your local computer to test the login flow by adding some final code to `app.py`:\\n\\nYou can run your Flask application with the following command in your terminal:\\n\\nFlask should print to your terminal where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running the development server. It should be `https://127.0.0.1:5000/`.\\n\\nNote that Flask\\xe2\\x80\\x99s development server is running locally _and_ using `https` to ensure an encrypted connection with Google. This is achieved by the `ssl_context=\"adhoc\"` argument to `app.run` in the code above. This requires you to have the package `PyOpenSSL` installed.\\n\\nThe downside is that the certificate used is generated on the fly, so when you go to `https://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser, it will probably give you a big warning screen about your connection being insecure or not private. You can effectively ignore these warnings.\\n\\nOnce past the warning screen, you should see a single button that says _Google Login_. Pressing it will send you to the official Google login. After you log in, Google will prompt you to consent to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthird-party application\\xe2\\x80\\x9d getting access to your email and profile information.\\n\\nAfter consenting, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be redirected back to your Flask application, where the page should show your Google email and public profile picture! Finally, a _Logout_ button allows you to, well, log out.\\n\\nConclusion[](#conclusion \"Permanent link\")\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nAllowing users to use their existing accounts to log into your web application has many benefits.

You must make an appointment with the International Student Advisor in order to do this. Please note: a Leave of Absence is not for students with medical conditions. Students wishing to take fewer classes or no classes entirely must apply for\\xc2\\xa0[Medical Reduced Courseload.](https://international.truman.edu/current-students/reduced-course-load/medical-reduced-course-load/)\\n\\n**IMPORTANT**: \\xc2\\xa0F-1 and J-1 students International students may NOT take a semester off and remain in the US.present in the US must be enrolled for a full course load or pre-approved reduced course load with appropriate documentation for one of the allowable reasons (medical or academic).\\n\\n**_How can I take a semester off?_**\\n\\nFirst, carefully read the information on this page. Then you will complete the\\xc2\\xa0[Immigration Leave of Absence Form](https://international.truman.edu/files/2020/07/Immigration-Leave-of-Absence-Form-Fillable-1.pdf)\\xc2\\xa0and submit it to the CIS office at least two weeks before you plan to leave.\\n\\nYou will also need to apply for an official Leave of Absence from the University. You can do so on the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Student\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Tab in Truview under \\xe2\\x80\\x98Registration.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 If you are taking a semester off for internships or study abroad, select \\xe2\\x80\\x98Planned Professional Leave.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 If you are taking semester off for personal reasons, select \\xe2\\x80\\x98Personal Leave.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n**_How long do you plan to be outside of the United States (more or fewer than 5 months)?_**\\n\\nIf you are outside of the United States 5 months or fewer, it might be possible to return on the same SEVIS record. If you are gone more than 5 months, it is not possible to return on the same SEVIS record. You will need a new I-20 issued, a new I-901 fee paid, a new visa acquired, and you must enter the US as a new student on an initial SEVIS record. If you enter on a new SEVIS record, you will not be eligible for OPT or CPT for another year.\\n\\n**NOTE**: If you complete the Spring semester, then summer break does NOT count toward your five month absence period because your SEVIS record will not be terminated until the start of the fall semester. The five month period begins the day your SEVIS record is terminated. If you leave before completing the Spring semester, then your SEVIS record will be terminated immediately and summer break will count toward your five months.\\n\\n**_When do you plan to depart the US? Do you already have a ticket?_**\\n\\nIf you withdraw from classes (either before or after the semester starts), you must depart the US within 15 days. If you have not yet registered for classes and decide to take a semester off, you should depart within 15 days of the beginning of the semester. You need to calculate your departure and return trips carefully if you wish to return on the same SEVIS record and I-20.\\n\\n**NOTE**: If you withdraw from classes, please make sure you have consulted with the Registrar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office as well as student accounts about your refund. You must withdraw early in order to get a full refund.\\n\\n**_When do you plan to return to the US? Do you already have a return ticket?_**\\n\\nIf you return to the US from a leave of absence (whether more or fewer than 5 months), you are not allowed to enter the US more than 30 days before classes begin, even if your visa is still valid.\\n\\n**NOTE**: When calculating a return date to the US, you should also factor in the 5 month rule so as not to be gone more than 5 months if you wish to return on the same SEVIS record.\\n\\n**_What is your current academic standing? Are you on probation? Will you receive any grades that will negatively affect your GPA?_**\\n\\nIf you are on probation when you take a semester off, you will continue on probation during their first semester back. If you require a probation contract through the Provost\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, you will need to have a signed contract on file with the Provost\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office before being allowed to re-enroll. If you have been suspended and return home, you must have an approved appeal on file before being re-admitted. Discuss this with your academic advisor before you decide to take a semester off.\\n\\n**NOTE**: If you are currently on probation and want to withdraw after classes have started, you have to check the drop dates set by the Registrar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget that a grade of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWF\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is calculated as a 0.0 and affects your semester GPA as well as the conditions of your probationary status.\\xc2\\xa0 Just because you withdraw from all classes doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee that you will not have a negative semester GPA.\\xc2\\xa0 If your academic standing goes from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprobation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuspended\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after you withdraw and leave the US, you may not be allowed to return to the University without an appeal approved by the Academic Standards Committee.\\n\\n**_What is your current financial status? Do you owe money or have any outstanding loans?_**\\n\\nIf you owe money, you will not be able enroll after a leave of absence until you have paid all tuition, fees, and loans. If a student leaves the US with an outstanding balance, you must have it paid off before your SEVIS record will be reactivated or a new I-20 issued.\\n\\n**NOTE**: Remember that you may not be refunded 100% of their semester tuition and fees depending on the time of the semester that they withdraw.\\xc2\\xa0 Students with extenuating circumstances may appeal for more of a refund than is standard by submitting the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[Enrollment Fees Appeal Form](http://wp-internal.truman.edu/registrar/files/2014/07/enrollmentfeeform201160.pdf)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xa0and any supporting documentation. Even students with an approved appeal or who withdraw before the semester starts may need to pay a portion of their student health insurance so that they are covered until they depart the US.\\n\\n**_Do you have any other issues (disciplinary / behavioral / criminal/medical) that could prevent you from returning?_**\\n\\nIf you have a disciplinary action pending with the University (via the Dean of Student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office), you should be aware of the effect the action will have upon your return.\\n\\nIf you have a criminal record or possibly even an arrest record, you may have trouble entering the U.S. This includes MIPs (tickets for Minor in Possession) and any possible drug-related offenses, however minor, even if you never told the Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa0about it. If you have ever had these issues or any kind of status violations may, you should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of taking a semester off.\\xc2\\xa0 The Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa0has no way of knowing exactly what government entities see or what the consequences will be for the student.\\n\\n**_What do you need to do to come back to Truman?_**\\n\\nIf will be gone for fewer than 5 months and return on the same SEVIS record and I-20 should log in to Truview and contact their advisor to make sure their account is up-to-date and that they are able to enroll in classes.\\n\\nIf you will be gone for more than five months and return on a new SEVIS record, you must re-apply to the University by submitting the following:\\n\\n1.  [**Online application**](https://international.truman.edu/international/apply-to-truman/)\\xc2\\xa0select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRe-applicant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the drop down menu next to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cApplying As.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n2.  **New**\\xc2\\xa0[**Certificate of Financial Support**](https://www.truman.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Certificate-of-Financial-Support-Updated-Fall-20141.pdf?x74029)\\xc2\\xa0\\n3.  **New**\\xc2\\xa0**Bank Documents**\\xe2\\x80\\x94originals or certified copies\\n4.  **Official Transcripts**\\xc2\\xa0of any course work completed during time away from Truman at another college or university (in the US or abroad)\\xe2\\x80\\x94if applicable\\n5.  **Appeal letter to Academic Standards Committee**\\xe2\\x80\\x94if applicable, email the Center for International Students for more information at\\xc2\\xa0[intladmit@truman.edu](http://intladmit@truman.edu/).\\n\\n**_What immigration documents do you need to come back?_**\\n\\nYou will need\\xc2\\xa0the following to re-enter the US:\\n\\n1.  Passport valid at least six months into the future\\n2.  Valid\\xc2\\xa0**visa**\\xc2\\xa0(the SEVIS ID Number on your visa should match the one on your I-20. If your visa is for another school, that is fine a long as it the dates are valid and SEVIS numbers match)\\n3.  Most recent\\xc2\\xa0**I-20 with a travel signature**\\xc2\\xa0(on page 2) fewer than 6 months old  \\n    (the Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa0can mail a new one to you if you do not have a valid travel signature, but you must pay for the shipping costs)\\n\\n**NOTE**: If you will be gone fewer than five months and need to renew your visa before returning to the US, contact the Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa030 days before your visa appointment. The Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa0must submit a request to return you to\\xe2\\x80\\x9cActive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d status before the visa interview.\\n\\n**_What will happen to the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SEVIS record upon departure (termination)?_**\\n\\nAny time an international student is not enrolled in a current term, the SEVIS record must be terminated. Termination is not always bad, it depends on the reason that you are terminated. If you consult with Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa0before you take a semester of, there will be a reason of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAuthorized Early Withdrawal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This note makes it significantly easier for you to return to Active status and come back to the United States. If you do not consult with the Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa0before you leave, your termination reason will be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnauthorized Withdrawal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This could make it more difficult for you to return to Active student status.\\n\\n**NOTE**: If a you withdraw from classes and are suspended from the University before action is taken on the SEVIS record, the reason for termination will be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuspension\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAuthorized Early Withdrawal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0 For this reason, if you are on probation, you must consider WF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and their calculation towards your GPA. For more information about this, contact your academic advisor.\\n\\n**_What will happen to your SEVIS record before re-entry?_**\\n\\n**Re-entry on New Record**: If have been gone from the US for more than 5 months, you must return on a new SEVIS record with a new I-20. The process will be same as when you first applied for your visa. You will reapply to Truman, receive a new I-20, and get a new visa. You will not be eligible for OPT or CPT for one full academic year when you return.\\n\\n**Reactivation of Old Record**: If you are gone from the US for 5 months or fewer, you will need to email the Center for International Students\\xc2\\xa060 days before you plan to return to the US with the following materials:\\n\\n1.  A statement that the student plans to return to the US and on which date (may enter the U.S. 30 days prior to the start of classes.\\n2.  Copy of travel itinerary for re-entry: showing date and flight information\\xc2\\xa0_in English_\\n3.  Confirmation that the student has used the Registrar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office website to request that transcripts be sent to the Center for International Students.\\n\\nThis will not affect your OPT or CPT eligibility.\\n\\n**_What will happen to your scholarship after a leave of absence?_**\\n\\nIf you return from a leave of absence and would like to have your scholarship again, you must submit an appeal to Melanee Crist, the Director of the Center for International Students, at [mcrist@truman.edu](mailto:rmorin@truman.edu).\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Scholarships are not held for students during a leave of absence and reinstatement of the scholarship (for students who otherwise meet the renewal criteria) is subject to the availability of scholarship funds at the time of the student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return.\\n\\n\\n[2] Title: Leave of Absence\\n[2] URL Source: https://iss.washington.edu/requests/time-off/leave-of-absence/\\n[2] Description: Once your immigration record is ... to work on-campus, through CPT, or through any other F-1 authorization.

Many who come for the world-renowned education end up staying in the United States after graduation and successfully contributing their skills and talents to the American workforce.\\n[5] Published Time: 2018-04-24T11:00:28+00:00\\n[5] Markdown Content:\\n![Image 1: International student graduate](https://usvisagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/jonathan-daniels-402033-unsplash-1024x684.jpg)For centuries, the United States has lured young talent from all over the world in the pursuit of higher education. Many who come for the world-renowned education end up staying in the United States after graduation and successfully contributing their skills and talents to the American workforce.\\n\\nAs an international student, you have an advantage in pursuing citizenship compared to other non-natives, because you have already been given access to enter legally for your education. When you graduate, you have several options for transferring your F-1 visa status into legal residency.\\n\\nOn your F-1 visa, you can only stay in the United States for 60 days after your graduation date, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in your best interests to start planning for your course of action well before you graduate. In this article, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explain seven options to extend your stay in the United States after you graduate.\\n\\nAn international student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path to employment-based citizenship\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen you decide to stay in the United States, you have a few paths you can take to remain in the country. Keep in mind that no matter which way you choose, becoming a permanent US legal resident can take many years. But, in the meantime, you can improve your chances by working in the US while you pursue citizenship.\\n\\nHere are three common employment-related ways to help extend your stay.\\n\\n### Optional practical training (OPT)\\n\\nOptional practical training is a program for undergraduate and graduate students on F-1 visas. OPT allows these students to stay and work in the United States for 12 months. To be eligible for this program, students must have either received their degree or have been studying in the US for one full academic year.\\n\\nSTEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) students or graduates may receive a 24-month extension of stay. However, this extended program only has a certain number of spots available. For more information on the [OPT STEM extension](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment/stem-opt), visit the USCIS website.\\n\\nIf you decide to take the OPT route after graduation, there are a few considerations you must keep in mind:\\n\\n*   Your employment must be related to your field of study.\\n*   You need to submit work authorization forms to USCIS to be deemed eligible for the program. Visit the [USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment/optional-practical-training) for more information.\\n*   If you are accepted into the program while you are still a student, you are only allowed to work up to 20 hours a week while school is in session.\\n\\nWhen performing a job search for OPT jobs, it may be helpful to reach out to the international student counselor at your university for guidance. Websites such as [OPT Nation](http://www.optnation.com/) may provide useful job leads as well. Try searching for a contract position that only requires an employee for a certain number of months. Employers often look for candidates who will stay at their company for the long term\\xe2\\x80\\x94contract positions are unique as the company is only looking to fill a position for a limited amount of time.\\n\\nWhile the OPT may only allow you to stay in the US for a year after your graduation, your employer may choose to petition for H-1B status for you. After graduation, you can apply for H-1B visa status or a green card instead of starting with OPT. However, OPT can help you create invaluable connections in your industry that can help you with sponsorship down the line. OPT provides a minimal amount of risk for employers and helps you build up your r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 while proving your work ethic to future employers.\\n\\n### H-1B visa (non-immigrant visa)\\n\\nAn international student can transfer their F-1 student visa status to an H-1B status with the help of a sponsoring US employer. The H-1B status allows the graduate student to live and work in the United States for up to six years. To be eligible for this type of visa, you must prove to USCIS that you are uniquely qualified for the position in the company because of your field of study.\\n\\nIn your fifth consecutive year of employment at the same company, your employer can file for employment-based permanent residency. This will extend your H-1B visa past the six-year limitation. [If you change jobs within the six-year period, you will need to apply for an H-1B visa again](https://usvisagroup.com/changing-jobs-h-1b-visa/).\\n\\nTo learn more about the different types of H-1B visas, and how to apply for a job that will sponsor your H-1B visa, read our article: [How To Land A Job That Will Sponsor Your H-1B Visa](https://usvisagroup.com/land-job-will-sponsor-h-1b-visa-united-states/).\\n\\n### Green card\\n\\nObtaining a green card is the ultimate goal for any non-native living in the United States. International students have the upper hand in receiving green card status because they have already spent an extended amount of time living in the United States legally.\\n\\nWhile an H-1B visa will only allow you to stay in the US for a limited number of years, a green card is your key to permanent residency. As a green card holder, you can work anywhere in the US, receive financial benefits, and live in the US indefinitely.\\n\\nBecause green card status is in high demand, it is also more difficult to obtain and usually takes many years. But it is not impossible. In the best-case scenario, while on another visa, you have proved to your US employer that you an invaluable member of their company, and as a result they sponsor your green card petition. However, green card sponsorships are not limited to employment-based petitions\\xe2\\x80\\x94you can also \\xe2\\x80\\x9cself-petition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for a green card. To learn more, visit the [Green Card Eligibility](https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/eligibility-categories) page on the USCIS website.\\n\\nAn international student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path to non-employment-based citizenship\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### Immediate family sponsorship\\n\\nIf you have an immediate family member who is a US citizen, they can sponsor you for green card status. To sponsor you, your family member must be a spouse, child over 21, parent, or sibling. You will need to prove your relationship through Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. You can learn more about this on the [Family of US Citizens](https://www.uscis.gov/family/family-us-citizens) page on the USCIS website.\\n\\n### Marriage\\n\\nYou can apply for a visa or permanent residency for yourself through a spouse or fianc\\xc3\\xa9. Marrying a US citizen will not automatically grant you US citizenship\\xe2\\x80\\x94you have to go through the process to prove that the marriage is valid and real.\\n\\n### Asylum\\n\\nIf you have been granted asylum in the United States and have been living in the US for at least one year, you can apply for green card status. At the time of your green card application, you may be required to prove that you are still an asylee under the original circumstances you were granted asylum for.\\n\\nTo continue to prove your asylee status, it is in your best interests to not travel outside the US, including to your home country, for an extended amount of time before receiving legal permanent residency.\\n\\n### Military service\\n\\nIf you are an international student who has attended a university in the United States for over two years, at the time of this article\\xe2\\x80\\x99s publication, you may be eligible to serve in the US military in specialized positions, like as an interpreter or in medical-related fields, without a green card. However, only citizens and green card holders can receive security clearances and higher ranking positions.\\n\\nWhile serving in the US military isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a clear path to green card status, it can provide you with an accelerated path to citizenship, because you will be eligible to skip the five years of required residency in the United States. However, it is important to note that the military cannot assist you in your path to citizenship, and you should be aware that this option may not be available in the near future.\\n\\nPreparing for your future before you graduate\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nWalking across the stage and receiving your diploma doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to mean the end of your time in the United States. But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait until a few months before graduation to start making plans for your extended stay. As an F-1 student, there are lots of ways you can start preparing early. For example, you are allowed to take unpaid internships while studying, and this work experience can help you land a job after graduation.\\n\\nThis could also work in your benefit by helping you become well-versed in the visa requirements and processes for potential employers, so you can help them through the process if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re unfamiliar with the requirements or allowances for visa holders.\\n\\nYou could also work on your interview skills and polish your r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9make sure your accomplishments and skills stand out, because this will encourage employers to make the extra effort to invest in you. To help you in your job search, here are a few helpful articles:\\n\\n*   [What To Expect At An American Job Interview](https://usvisagroup.com/expect-american-job-interview/)\\n*   [How To Land A Job That Will Sponsor Your H-1B Visa](https://usvisagroup.com/land-job-will-sponsor-h-1b-visa-united-states/)\\n*   [Ace The Job Interview (Even If You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Not Fluent In English)](https://usvisagroup.com/ace-job-interview-even-youre-not-fluent-english/)\\n\\nAs always, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here to help you start a new chapter of your life in the United States.

In 1536 Spanish Conquistadors conquered Peru, discovered the flavors of potato, and brought them back to Europe.\\n\\n[More Potato History](https://potatogoodness.com/potato-fun-facts-history/)\\n\\n![Image 10](https://potatogoodness.com/wp-content/themes/uspb/images/play-large.png)\\n\\n###### Watch\\n\\n\\xc3\\x97\\n\\nGrowing and Harvesting Potatoes\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nLearn about the process of growing and harvesting U.S. potatoes.\\n\\n##### Potato Varieties\\n\\nRusset Potatoes\\n---------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nRussets are ideal for light and fluffy mashed potatoes. They also fry up crisp and golden brown, and are the potato of choice for baking. The delicate flavor and fluffy texture of baked russets goes well with a variety of toppings, from traditional sour cream and chives to spicy and bold Mediterranean or Latin flavors. Try cutting into planks or wedges to make delicious homemade fries.\\n\\n[Learn more about Russet Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/russet-potatoes/)\\n\\nRed Potatoes\\n------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nBecause of their waxy texture, the flesh of red potatoes stays firm throughout the cooking process. Their thin yet vibrant red skin adds appealing color and texture to side dishes or salads. Reds are frequently used to make potato salad or add pizazz to soups and stews, but can also be served baked or mashed. Round reds are often referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew potatoes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew\\xe2\\x80\\x9d technically refers to any type of potato that is harvested before reaching maturity.\\n\\n[Learn more about Red Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/red-potatoes/)\\n\\nWhite Potatoes\\n--------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nWhite potatoes hold their shape well after cooking. Their delicate, thin skins add just the right amount of texture to a velvety mashed potato dish without the need for peeling. Grilling whites brings out a more full-bodied flavor. Try adding potatoes to your salad by tossing cooked white potatoes into your Caesar or a creamy garlic parmesan dressing.\\n\\n[Learn more about White Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/white-potatoes/)\\n\\nYellow Potatoes\\n---------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nGrilling gives yellow potatoes a crispy skin that enhances the dense flesh, creating a slightly sweet, caramelized flavor. The naturally smooth buttery texture makes delicious baked, roasted, or mashed potatoes. Simmer yellow potatoes until fully cooked, drain, chill, and gently \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into flat disks. Brown these in oil or clarified butter and serve as a side or appetizer. Then top with a garnish of your choice.\\n\\n[Learn more about Yellow Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/yellow-potatoes/)\\n\\nPurple Potatoes\\n---------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nMost blue/purple potatoes have moist, firm flesh that retains its shape while adding rich, vibrant color and luscious taste to salads. The purple color is preserved best by microwaving but steaming and baking are also great ways to cook purple potatoes. Because of their mild yet distinctly nutty flavor, blue/purple potatoes naturally complement green salad flavors. Red, White, and Blues\\xe2\\x80\\x94Combine blue potatoes with whites and reds in salads or roasted medleys to make all three colors \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\n[Learn more about Purple Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/purple-potatoes/)\\n\\nFingerling Potatoes\\n-------------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nFingerling color and shape are a welcome visual addition to any dish. Pan-frying and roasting enhances their robust flavor and showcases their wonderful nutty or buttery tastes. Consider fingerlings as a change-of-pace foundation for a unique potato salad. Split fingerlings lengthwise and oven-roast to serve as a small-plate or side-dish alternative to fries. Accompany them with a flavorful dipping sauce, like spicy ketchup, romesco, or sriracha mayo.\\n\\n[Learn more about Fingerling Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/fingerling-potatoes/)\\n\\nPetite Potatoes\\n---------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nRoast a combination of colors for an eye-catching side dish. Petites concentrated flavors and quicker cooking time makes them a good choice for potato salads. You can also toss petite potatoes in olive oil, rosemary, and salt and pepper to make colorful, delicious, and fun roasted potatoes. Petites save on prep time because they can be prepared and served whole without slicing or chopping.\\n\\n[Learn more about Petite Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/petite-potatoes/)\\n\\nInstant Potatoes\\n----------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nInstant (or dehydrated) potatoes deliver all the flavor, versatility and nutrition of real, fresh potatoes because they are real potatoes, minus the water. Whole potatoes are actually put through an advanced process to create premium dehydrated/instant potato products. Thanks to the careful processing techniques used, instant potato products retain most of their nutrition.\\n\\n[Learn more about Instant Potatoes](https://potatogoodness.com/instant-potatoes/)\\n\\nPotato Chips\\n------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nA chef by the name of George Crum created the potato chip in a petty way to appease a particularly picky guest, Cornelius Vanderbilt, who had sent his fried potatoes back for being too thick. Crum sliced them thin and fried them to a crisp out of spite. Rather than be offended by the jab, Vanderbilt was delighted. Soon after, other guests began requesting to try the thinly sliced fried potatoes. Before long, each patron was served a complimentary basket of potato chips with the meal.\\n\\n[Learn more about Potato Chips](https://potatogoodness.com/potato-chips/)\\n\\nFrozen Potatoes\\n---------------\\n\\n\\x14  \\nDid you know, the U.S. potato industry has long pioneered state-of-the-art technologies that instantly quick-freeze potatoes to lock in fresh flavor and nutrition?

While there are **more than 200 varieties** in the USA alone and **4,000/5,000 in the whole world**, each of those falls into one of the 7 different types: russet, red, white, yellow, blue/purple, fingerling, and petite. Each falls into one of the three textural categories, used for a different purpose - starchy, waxy, and all-purpose. Keep on reading for an in-depth guide to everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite vegetable.\\n\\nThe 3 main categories of potato\\n-------------------------------\\n\\n**Starchy potatoes** are good for baking and frying, high in starch and low in moisture. With an absorbent and fluffy texture, it means they can easily absorb fats, dairy, and other flavours. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re unsure whether the potato you have is a starchy one, try pricking it: a starchy potato will release a milky liquid. These are perfect for baked potatoes, hash browns or frying for crispy potatoes. Although if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re mashing do be careful to not overwork them as they can turn gluey.\\n\\n**Waxy potatoes** are the opposite - they are lower in starch with more moisture and high sugar content. They have a firmer and more smooth texture, meaning they can handle being boiled and cut into small pieces and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t release a starchy liquid. These are good for adding into stews, potato salads, and thinly sliced for potato gratins and scalloped potatoes.\\n\\n**All-purpose potatoes** are a middle ground, with less starch than starchy potatoes but not quite as firm as waxy ones. These can be used for most potato dishes.\\n\\nOften maligned by health enthusiasts, **potatoes are packed with nutrients** like potassium, vitamins C and B6, and fibre, making them great additions to your diet. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re full of complex carbohydrates and very low in fat, a great and filling alternative to gluten-rich pastas or breads. Aside from cooking, potatoes can even be used to **[generate electricity](https://www.finedininglovers.com/article/potato-z-26-things-you-didnt-know-about-potatoes)**... Although we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend powering your house with them.\\n\\n### Russet\\n\\n![Image 1: russet potatoes \\xc2\\xa9iStock](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/2020-12/russet_potatoes%C2%A9iStock.jpg)\\n\\nRussets are **the most common type of potato** you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find in the supermarket, and are also known as Idaho potatoes in the USA. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the most widely cultivated potato in North America, and McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice favourite. Brown, large, and with a thick skin, these are the floury types you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll turn to for baking and mashing. Their large size makes them perfect for topping with sour cream or cheesy beans, or turning into hasselback stuffed dishes.\\n\\n### Red potato\\n\\n![Image 2: red potatoes \\xc2\\xa9iStock](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/2020-12/red_potatoes%C2%A9iStock.jpg)\\n\\nRed potatoes are the most common type of waxy potato. **Their red skins are full of nutrients, so opt for organic potatoes and keep the skin on when preparing**. Red potatoes in particular have more potassium per serving than any other fruit or vegetable, even bananas. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also less calorific than the classic russet, with a bit **more vitamin K and niacin**. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll withstand being boiled and pan-fried, with a creamy and smooth texture and a lightly sweet taste. Perfect for adding into a pot roast stew or a potato salad, with a thin skin that adds a pleasant bite.\\n\\n### White\\n\\nWhite potatoes have a pale white flesh and thin skin with a medium starch level, an all-purpose type that is similar to but slightly denser than a russet. They still hold their shape well, making them **suitable for everything from mashing to salads**. White potatoes in particular get a bad rap, but as with all whole foods, eating them in a close-to-natural state when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve retained their nutritional value makes them a welcome addition to any diet (although they can increase your blood sugar in high levels, so moderation is advised).\\n\\n![Image 3: yellow potatoes \\xc2\\xa9iStock](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/2020-12/yellow_potatoes%C2%A9iStock.jpg)\\n\\n### Yellow potatoes\\n\\nYellow potatoes are another waxy variety with an almost **velvety and buttery texture**, and lightly sweet. The skin gets crispy which is a beautiful contrast to the buttery flesh, making yellow potatoes **a great option for grilling or roasting**. Common varieties include Yukon Gold, Yellow Finn, German Butterball, and Carola potatoes.\\n\\n### Purple potatoes\\n\\nPurple, or blue potatoes, are not only visually striking but also **packed with antioxidants**, like most other blue or purple foods. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all-purpose with slightly more firm flesh and a nutty and earthy flavour, perfect for tons of applications from **baking** to **grilling**.\\n\\n### Fingerling potatoes\\n\\n![Image 4: fingerling potatoes \\xc2\\xa9iStock](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/2020-12/fingerling_potatoes%C2%A9iStock.jpg)\\n\\nThese **small potatoes are the choice option for pan-frying or roasting up**. With a generally waxy and firm flesh, and ranging in colour and veined appearance, fingerlings are a popular selection if you want to impress guests at a dinner party.\\n\\n### Petite potatoes\\n\\n![Image 5: baby potatoes \\xc2\\xa9iStock](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/2020-12/baby_potatoes%C2%A9iStock.jpg)\\n\\nPetite potatoes aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually a type, but rather a smaller version of one of the categories above. Because of the smaller size, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be **more concentrated in flavour**, and like fingerlings, are **a lovely choice for frying and using in salads**. And because of their small size, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll save on prep time.\\n\\nSweet Potaoes\\n-------------\\n\\nSweet potatoes, although called potatoes, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually part of the same family. **While regular potatoes are classified as tubers, sweet potatoes are root vegetables** and part of the nightshade family. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rather different in texture and density, as well as nutritional composition. And **don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t confuse them with yams** either. Real yams are an entirely different vegetable with a starchy and dense flesh and a bark-like skin, in contrast to the sweet potatoes' sweet and soft interior. However, most 'yams'\\xc2\\xa0in American grocery stores are actually just orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, which is most\\xc2\\xa0likely where the confusion arises.\\n\\nHow to store your potatoes\\n--------------------------\\n\\nNo matter what hue, shape, or size of potato strikes your fancy, there are some universal rules for storing the tuber to make it stay fresh longer. The number one guideline is to keep potatoes **in a dark place** (if you have a spooky root cellar, perfect, otherwise a dark cupboard or pantry will have to do). Potatoes exposed to sunlight start getting ready to sprout and actually develop a poisonous compound called solanine to fend off hungry critters. The tuber turns green when solanine is present. Also, keep your taters dry by **storing them in a basket**, bowl, or paper bag rather than a plastic bag, and by keeping them out of the fridge.\\n\\nRecipe ideas\\n------------\\n\\n![Image 6: mashed_potatoes_friters\\xc2\\xa9iStock](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/2020-11/mashed_potatoes_friters%C2%A9iStock.jpg)\\n\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a myriad of ways to use up potatoes, including when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already cooked.

With so many varieties available, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to know which one will work best for your dish so here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a guide to the different types of potatoes and what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re best suited to so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never be stuck again!\\n\\nPotatoes are categorised into 3 basic types \\xe2\\x80\\x93 starchy, waxy and all-purpose.\\n\\n#### Starchy:\\n\\nStarchy potatoes are high in starch, low in moisture and have a floury texture with creamy white flesh. Starchy Potatoes release a milky, starchy liquid if pricked or cut. They also tend to be long and have a coarser skin.\\n\\n**Varieties:**  \\nKing Edward  \\nRussets  \\nSweet potatoes\\n\\n**When to use:**  \\nStarchy potatoes are fluffy and absorbent which makes them great for baking and frying so use them to make crispy potatoes, hot chips, wedges, mashed potato cakes or hash browns. They can also be mashed but are susceptible to becoming stodgy when overworked.\\n\\n**When to avoid:**  \\nBecause of their high starch content, starchy potatoes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hold together very well when cooked so avoid using them in dishes that require boiling, roasting or slicing like casseroles, potato bakes, gratins or potato salads.\\n\\n#### Waxy:\\n\\nWaxy potatoes have less starch than Starchy potatoes and contain more moisture and sugar. They are often smaller with a waxy outer skin and a creamy, firm and moist flesh.\\n\\n**Varieties:**  \\nDutch Cream  \\nKipfler  \\nNadine  \\nNicola  \\nPatrone  \\nPink Eye (Southern Gold)  \\nPink Fir Apple  \\nPurple Congo\\n\\n**When to use:**  \\nWaxy potatoes hold their shape well after cooking so are great for boiling, roasting or slicing. Use them to cook casseroles, soups or potato salads.\\n\\n**When to avoid:**  \\nWaxy potatoes are not good for mashing because they hold their form and produce a chunky mash. They are also avoided for baking and deep frying.\\n\\n#### All-Purpose:\\n\\nAll-purpose potatoes have a medium starch content that fall somewhere in between starchy and waxy potatoes. They have more moisture that starchy Potatoes and hold together in boiling water.\\n\\n**Varieties:**  \\nColiban  \\nDesiree  \\nGolden Delight  \\nOtway Red  \\nPontiac  \\nRed Rascal  \\nRoyal Blue  \\nSebago  \\nSpunta  \\nToolangi Delight  \\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x98New\\xe2\\x80\\x99 potatoes)  \\nYukon gold\\n\\n**When to use:**  \\nAll Purpose Potatoes are particularly useful for roasting, pan frying, stewing and are good in soups or gratins such as [Potato Dauphinoise](https://theneffkitchen.com.au/recipes_techniques/dauphinoise-potato/).\\n\\n**When to avoid:**  \\nThey can be baked, mashed, or deep fried like a starchy potato, but will not produce the same fluffy texture. You can use all-purpose potatoes for just about anything but if you have a specific dish in mind that lends itself to a starchy or waxy potato, then opt for those types instead.\\n\\n**Potato recipes**\\n\\nLooking for popular potato recipes and tips?\\n\\n*   [How to make crispy potatoes](https://theneffkitchen.com.au/how-to-make-crispy-potatoes/)\\n*   [How to make baked potato chips](https://theneffkitchen.com.au/make-baked-potato-chips-home/)\\n*   [Cheesy jacket potatoes recipe](https://theneffkitchen.com.au/recipes_techniques/cheesy-jacket-potatoes/)\\n\\n[![Image 1: Need help?

Surprising, right? Or maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as shocking as it sounds. Over 200 different potato types are sold in the US, implying at least 200 different uses.\\n\\nWith so many on the market, it can be confusing to know which type of potato to purchase. This guide will help explain the difference between common types of potatoes _and_ how to use them when cooking to get the best tasting results.\\n\\nThe Potato Spectrum\\n-------------------\\n\\nYou might be thinking: _do we really need an entire guide?_ _They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all potatoes, they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t taste that different._ And to that, we present the potato spectrum.\\n\\nPotatoes are split into 3 different classifications: starchy, waxy, and all-purpose. These classifications are given based on their texture, starch content, and moisture. Every potato type falls somewhere along this spectrum.\\n\\n### Starchy Potatoes\\n\\nStarchy potatoes earned their name because of their high starch content. Their thick, dry skin absorbs oil and becomes crispy when baked. High in starch means low in moisture; as the outer layer becomes crispy, the flesh of the potato softens.\\n\\nThe crispy exterior but fluffy interior makes starchy potatoes perfect for fried potatoes, baked potatoes, or french fries. When peeled before cooking, they are also great candidates for recipes that require boiling and mashing.\\n\\n### Waxy Potatoes\\n\\nOn the other end of the spectrum are waxy potatoes, which are low in starch but high in moisture.\\n\\nIn terms of appearance, their skin is much thinner. Unlike starchy ones, which become soft when cooked, waxy potatoes hold their shape. This makes them good for making soups or stews, potato salads, or casseroles.\\n\\nIn general, they are best used for roasting, boiling, and slicing.\\n\\n### All-Purpose Potatoes\\n\\nAll-purpose potatoes are the best of both worlds. They fall between starchy and waxy on the potato spectrum because they have medium starch and moisture content.\\n\\nThis makes them the most versatile potatoes for cooking because they can be substituted for recipes that require starchy or waxy potato types. Therefore, they can be used for roasting, mashing, pan frying, stewing, soups \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you name it.\\n\\n[![Image 1: The potato spectrum; a chart that places different potato types in a line based upon their starch content](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mkts-potatoe-varties-graphic-03-round2-03.jpg)](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mkts-potatoe-varties-graphic-03-round2-03.jpg)\\n\\nPopular Potato Types & Uses\\n---------------------------\\n\\nNow that you understand the classifications of potatoes, we can explore the most common types of potatoes and how you can use them to pair with your favorite meals!\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Russet\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\n![Image 2: Basket of large russet potatoes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/russet.jpeg)\\n\\nRussets are the holy grail of **starchy potatoes**, as they are the most popular potato in their category. They are often the largest in size when compared to other potato types. Their skin is thick and dry, but their flesh is absorbent like a sponge when cooked.\\n\\nTheir starchy qualities make russet potatoes great for baking and frying. They work best for recipes that want to achieve an initial crunch with a velvety interior like hash browns, potato wedges, and [fresh-cut french fries](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/blog/homemade-french-fries/)!\\n\\nRusset potatoes can also be used in recipes that require mashing or boiling when their skin is peeled before cooking. They are often used to make silky mashed potatoes or [homemade gnocchi](https://rasamalaysia.com/how-to-make-gnocchi/).\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Red\\n\\n![Image 3: Closeup of red potaotes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/red.jpeg)\\n\\nRed potatoes are **waxy**. They are smaller to medium in size, with smooth red skin. Since they are of the waxy potato type, they are high in moisture which keeps them firm during the cooking process.\\n\\nTheir thin skin requires little to no preparation; in fact, many people leave the skin of the red potato on while being cooked to add an appealing pop of color to the menu. Plus, its texture adds an earthy flavor to your recipe.\\n\\nRed potatoes taste best when grilled, steamed, roasted, or stewed. They also work great in potato salads. [Use red potatoes to make your own](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/in-the-kitchen/pennsylvania-dutch-side-dishes/) Amish potato salad!\\n\\n### 3\\\\. White\\n\\n![Image 4: A pile of white potatoes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/white-e1659362545534.jpeg)\\n\\nOur first **all-purpose** potato type is white potatoes. Like reds, they are small to medium in size and their thin skin doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require peeling before cooking. When grilled, white potatoes have a rich, heavy flavor that tastes great on salads or with grilled vegetables.\\n\\nSince they are considered all-purpose, they can be used for most potato recipes. Their texture after preparation is often described as velvety thick. Use them in mashed potatoes, salads, sauteed vegetables, or baked casseroles.\\n\\nAlso, try using all-purpose whites to make traditional [PA Dutch potato filling](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/in-the-kitchen/pennsylvania-dutch-side-dishes/)! Simply explained, potato filling is a potato-based stuffing that is served on holidays and throughout the year in Amish tradition.\\n\\n### 4\\\\. Yellow\\n\\n![Image 5: Pot of round yellow potatoes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/yellow-e1659362570555.jpeg)\\n\\nYellow potatoes fall on the **waxy** side of the spectrum. They can be anywhere from the size of a marble to the size of a baseball. Their smooth skin is light tan to golden in color, and their flavor is best described as buttery and rich.\\n\\nThis makes them taste savory in baked, roasted, and mashed potatoes. When grilled, their skin carmelizes to give them a delightful crunch that pairs well with their firm flesh. Try out these [grilled yellow potato planks](https://potatogoodness.com/recipes/grilled-yellow-potato-planks/) to see what we mean.\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Yukon Gold\\n\\n![Image 6: Assortment of Yukon gold potatoes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/yukon.jpeg)\\n\\nThe age-long debate: are yellow potatoes the same as Yukon gold? Though they might look the same, their placement on the potato spectrum is different. Yukon potatoes are considered **all-purpose**, not waxy like yellow potatoes.\\n\\nTheir smooth, yellow skin often gets them confused with regular yellow potatoes, _BUT_ they are not the same. Yukon golds are a hybrid of white potatoes and yellow potatoes. This means they have qualities of all-purpose _and_ waxy potatoes.\\n\\nThis makes them another super versatile potato for cooking. They can be swapped for any potato type in pretty much any recipe because they taste delicious when mashed, roasted, boiled, fried, or saut\\xc3\\xa9d.\\n\\nLike yellow potatoes, they have a naturally buttery flavor. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why they are often the potato of choice to make mashed potatoes. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking to make velvety, subtly-sweet mashed potatoes, try this Yukon gold [mashed potatoes recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/perfect_mashed_potatoes/).\\n\\nOne of our favorite ways to use Yukon gold potatoes is in a breakfast [fried potato hash](https://farmlifediy.com/potato-hash-recipe/). All you need is some small to medium-sized Yukon potatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper, and any additional seasonings you like.\\n\\nWe also like to add some [fresh onion](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/in-the-kitchen/types-of-onions-and-uses/) and green pepper [from the farmers market](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/blog/amish-farmers-market-benefits/) to our hash, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totally optional. Other things you could add to your hash: bacon, sausage, eggs, mushrooms, steak (really anything that you think sounds appealing).\\n\\n### 6\\\\. Purple/Blue\\n\\n![Image 7: Group of small, purple potatoes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/purple.jpeg)\\n\\nAnother type of **all-purpose** potato is the purple potato. As it sounds, their skin is a deep purple or blue color. Their flesh can be purple, blue, pink, or white. Similar to red potatoes, they have an earthy flavor, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sometimes described as having a nutty flavor too.\\n\\nWhen cooked, their color is preserved which gives a pop of color to your plate when served. They taste best grilled or steamed, and their nutty flavor makes them the perfect addition to a leafy green salad. Use them to make some healthy [baked potato chips](https://mindovermunch.com/recipes/baked-potato-chips/).\\n\\n### 7\\\\. Fingerling\\n\\n![Image 8: Mixture of white and purple fingerling potatoes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fingerling.jpeg)\\n\\nLike purple potatoes, fingerling potatoes can also add some color to your dish. They come in many different colors: red, orange, purple, white, yellow, and more. But these potatoes fall along the **waxy** end of the potato spectrum.\\n\\nIn terms of shape, fingerling potatoes are small but oblong resembling fingers. (Hence, the name \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_finger_ling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Their taste is buttery like a yellow potato but nutty and earthy like a purple potato. They taste best when pan-fried or roasted. Try using them to make [garlic butter potatoes](https://www.thekitchn.com/fingerling-potatoes-recipe-23072760)!\\n\\n### 8\\\\. Petite\\n\\n![Image 9: Plate of uncooked petite potatoes](https://www.marketsatshrewsbury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/petite.jpeg)\\n\\nPetite \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbaby\\xe2\\x80\\x9d potatoes\\xe2\\x80\\x93 are **waxy**. They are potatoes that have been harvested before they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve reached maturity. Their texture, color, and shape resemble the characteristics of their larger potato types.\\n\\nTheir size makes them a go-to choice for roasting, pan-frying, and topping salads because they require no preparation. No time is wasted peeling or chopping the potatoes because they are already bite-sized!\\n\\nTry using petite potatoes to make [crispy smashed potatoes](https://www.loveandlemons.com/crispy-smashed-potatoes/) as a yummy side dish! They are the perfect blend of crispy and creamy.\\n\\nAt this point, you should be a spud master! We hope this blog helps you get the most taste from your potatoes.
