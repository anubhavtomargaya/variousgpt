      "[02:03.120 --> 02:08.120]  I know that I'm sitting in front of the computer, so I have access on the number.\n",
      "[02:08.120 --> 02:12.120]  But please forgive me if I'm talking with too many numbers.\n",
      "[02:12.120 --> 02:17.120]  But water as a whole, it was an outstanding performance for the water.\n",
      "[02:17.120 --> 02:20.120]  But here as a whole, also the company has done pretty well.\n",
      "[02:20.120 --> 02:26.120]  Since it's an annual result, so in the annual thing, we discussed the company as a whole also.\n",
      "[02:26.120 --> 02:29.120]  But on the quarterly basis, these are the pure simple numbers.\n",
      "[02:29.120 --> 02:35.120]  Just to address the participants who are joining the staff of calls for the first time.\n",
      "[02:35.120 --> 02:39.120]  We have primarily two types of business segments.\n",
      "[02:39.120 --> 02:43.120]  One is medical devices and one is the bulk drums of APIs.\n",
      "[02:43.120 --> 02:45.120]  These are more than equal.\n",
      "[02:45.120 --> 02:49.120]  So 80% of the revenue comes from medical devices and APIs.\n",
      "[02:49.120 --> 02:53.120]  And API, of course, is our traditional business, our old business.\n",
      "[02:53.120 --> 02:55.120]  This is our Ash Cow.\n",
      "[02:55.120 --> 02:59.120]  And the company started from the API only.\n",
      "[02:59.120 --> 03:02.120]  Medical devices is relatively new, and it's relatively new.\n",
      "[03:02.120 --> 03:05.120]  It's still almost 20 years old now.\n",
      "[03:05.120 --> 03:09.120]  But medical devices is the fastest growing business in the company.\n",
      "[03:09.120 --> 03:15.120]  Then back in 2015, 16, 17 years, we have a 5,600 code company.\n",
      "[03:15.120 --> 03:18.120]  Medical devices is only 13% of the revenue.\n",
      "[03:18.120 --> 03:23.120]  But now medical devices is 26%, more than 26% of the revenue.\n",
      "[03:23.120 --> 03:25.120]  This is growing much faster.\n",
      "[03:25.120 --> 03:30.120]  The company in last seven years has grown with a CGR of 16%.\n",
      "[03:30.120 --> 03:33.120]  CGR is Kaggle Compounded Annual Growth Rate.\n",
      "[03:33.120 --> 03:36.120]  The company has grown at a Kaggle of 16%.\n",
      "[03:36.120 --> 03:42.120]  But medical devices has outsmarted and grown at CGR of 28% year-on-year.\n",
      "[03:42.120 --> 03:50.120]  So that's why I'm saying it's fastest growing the segment within the morphing.\n",
      "[03:50.120 --> 03:57.120]  And when you say medical devices, we are talking primarily of the home medical devices.\n",
      "[03:57.120 --> 03:59.120]  We are into point-of-care medical devices.\n",
      "[03:59.120 --> 04:02.120]  Point-of-care is used in hospitals also sometimes.\n",
      "[04:02.120 --> 04:07.120]  We have some patient monitors and other things that are used on the bedside of the patient.\n",
      "[04:07.120 --> 04:10.120]  But we are specialized in the home diagnostics.\n",
      "[04:10.120 --> 04:15.120]  And we have built a beautiful brand Dr. Morphing around customer service\n",
      "[04:15.120 --> 04:20.120]  and around more consumer awareness, more one-on-one interaction in the customer.\n",
      "[04:20.120 --> 04:25.120]  So we sell our goods directly to over 3,000 distributors all over the country.\n",
      "[04:25.120 --> 04:29.120]  And of course, network of more than 125,000 retailers.\n",
      "[04:29.120 --> 04:33.120]  So we have a more consumer company and a typical diagnostics company.\n",
      "[04:33.120 --> 04:36.120]  And we are not into testing that stuff.\n",
      "[04:36.120 --> 04:39.120]  We are a device. That's why we always call it devices.\n",
      "[04:39.120 --> 04:44.120]  The second business, of course, is Valkyrie, an API which is an established business\n",
      "[04:44.120 --> 04:49.120]  giving good cash flows and growing at its own good speed.\n",
      "[04:49.120 --> 04:54.120]  Between these two, this is 80%, then we have a range of formulations and OTP products\n",
      "[04:54.120 --> 04:57.120]  which is typical in any pharma company.\n",
      "[04:57.120 --> 05:01.120]  But medical devices are typically our unique positioning.\n",
      "[05:01.120 --> 05:06.120]  Moving specifically to the so-called key positioning of the company,\n",
      "[05:06.120 --> 05:09.120]  the key achievements that we have been able to do.\n",
      "[05:09.120 --> 05:14.120]  In both medical devices, we have two leading products, ET monitor and glucose monitor.\n",
      "[05:14.120 --> 05:16.120]  One is a glucose monitoring machine.\n",
      "[05:16.120 --> 05:20.120]  And wherein you buy the meter and then you buy the strip family.\n",
      "[05:20.120 --> 05:22.120]  One is a blood pressure monitor.\n",
      "[05:22.120 --> 05:24.120]  We are the market retailers in both the products.\n",
      "[05:24.120 --> 05:27.120]  And we are manufacturing in-house.\n",
      "[05:27.120 --> 05:30.120]  In-house, we manufacture data about factory.\n",
      "[05:30.120 --> 05:34.120]  And we manufacture for basic beer PCBs.\n",
      "[05:34.120 --> 05:36.120]  And therefore, the MD line for that.\n",
      "[05:36.120 --> 05:37.120]  I'll come to that later.\n",
      "[05:37.120 --> 05:40.120]  And within API, we have category leaders.\n",
      "[05:40.120 --> 05:42.120]  It's API 612 products.\n",
      "[05:42.120 --> 05:44.120]  So I don't want to confuse you with the name,\n",
      "[05:44.120 --> 05:49.120]  but just to mention, these are lauratary, desoratary, monitor, and guard.\n",
      "[05:49.120 --> 05:52.120]  And there are three more products where we have products.\n",
      "[05:52.120 --> 05:55.120]  So there are six products where we are the market leaders.\n",
      "[05:55.120 --> 05:58.120]  So all APIs are exported.\n",
      "[05:58.120 --> 06:02.120]  Around 68% of the business in the API is from export.\n",
      "[06:02.120 --> 06:07.120]  Our currency dollar export to advanced countries is related markets.\n",
      "[06:07.120 --> 06:12.120]  And of course, the company has been consistently growing both in top line and bottom line.\n",
      "[06:12.120 --> 06:15.120]  With the help of the internal cash approval,\n",
      "[06:15.120 --> 06:20.120]  the company has been able to clear all its own debts with all the banks.\n",
      "[06:20.120 --> 06:23.120]  And whatever structure the way it works,\n",
      "[06:23.120 --> 06:26.120]  we are a debt-free company with negligible debt.\n",
      "[06:26.120 --> 06:30.120]  Let me say negligible debt means we have simple car loans and other things.\n",
      "[06:30.120 --> 06:33.120]  Rather, we have fixed deposits in the bank,\n",
      "[06:33.120 --> 06:36.120]  which are sometimes used for the overall facility.\n",
      "[06:36.120 --> 06:38.120]  We are not certified for the fixed deposits.\n",
      "[06:38.120 --> 06:40.120]  So we are a debt-free company.\n",
      "[06:40.120 --> 06:44.120]  So as we talk, we are celebrating the 40th year of our journey.\n",
      "[06:44.120 --> 06:50.120]  So we say that we have entered into the 40th year with more energy,\n",
      "[06:50.120 --> 06:54.120]  more agility, and more performance and internal approach.\n",
      "[06:54.120 --> 06:57.120]  We are making more and more particular decisions in the company\n",
      "[06:57.120 --> 07:03.120]  and how do we improve our performance and how do we better our prosperity.\n",
      "[07:03.120 --> 07:08.120]  That was a broad thing coming specifically to the operational performance.\n",
      "[07:08.120 --> 07:12.120]  During this year, the revenue has grown by 20 percent.\n",
      "[07:12.120 --> 07:16.120]  From 1,424 crores, we have grown to 1,704 crores.\n",
      "[07:16.120 --> 07:22.120]  So almost 20 percent, 19.97 percent, 20 percent growth in the annual revenue.\n",
      "[07:22.120 --> 07:28.120]  On a quarterly basis also, the revenue has grown 16.5 percent for the Q4.\n",
      "[07:28.120 --> 07:32.120]  So consistently for the nine months also, there was an increase.\n",
      "[07:32.120 --> 07:34.120]  And here in the whole, it's 20 percent increase.\n",
      "[07:34.120 --> 07:40.120]  And just to update you that last year, the year was not so good.\n",
      "[07:40.120 --> 07:44.120]  But because post COVID, there was not a few entries in the market\n",
      "[07:44.120 --> 07:46.120]  and the market was a bit slower.\n",
      "[07:46.120 --> 07:48.120]  Now there is a good comeback.\n",
      "[07:48.120 --> 07:50.120]  And the fresh buying has started.\n",
      "[07:50.120 --> 07:56.120]  And particularly in medical devices, because it is more primarily based in India,\n",
      "[07:56.120 --> 07:58.120]  so we have better access and better control.\n",
      "[07:58.120 --> 08:01.120]  So the comeback and the rollback is much faster.\n",
      "[08:01.120 --> 08:04.120]  So medical devices have grown by 35 percent.\n",
      "[08:04.120 --> 08:07.120]  API business has grown by 14 percent.\n",
      "[08:07.120 --> 08:09.120]  Some countries are still shying away.\n",
      "[08:09.120 --> 08:15.120]  And of course, on the positive side, the last couple of years,\n",
      "[08:15.120 --> 08:19.120]  import prices, particularly from China, were disturbed.\n",
      "[08:19.120 --> 08:22.120]  And rather, they were higher than expected.\n",
      "[08:22.120 --> 08:24.120]  But now the import prices have also softened.\n",
      "[08:24.120 --> 08:29.120]  And our margins have increased in the last three-four quarters.\n",
      "[08:29.120 --> 08:33.120]  We're happy to announce that, of course, you can see in the days of respect\n",
      "[08:33.120 --> 08:37.120]  the company's overall productivity and margin that one up.\n",
      "[08:37.120 --> 08:42.120]  A bit of the company, which is earning before interest depreciation\n",
      "[08:42.120 --> 08:48.120]  and, of course, taxation, so it has doubled more than 101 percent increase\n",
      "[08:48.120 --> 08:50.120]  from 85 crore beta last year.\n",
      "[08:50.120 --> 08:56.120]  We have 173 crore, almost 173 crore beta, 172.6.\n",
      "[08:56.120 --> 09:00.120]  And the profit after tax also is 150 percent up.\n",
      "[09:00.120 --> 09:05.120]  It's two-and-a-half times from 38 crores to almost 97 crores.\n",
      "[09:05.120 --> 09:08.120]  So 39 crores to 97 crores.\n",
      "[09:08.120 --> 09:10.120]  Annual payout has gone up.\n",
      "[09:10.120 --> 09:12.120]  So almost 90-50 percent increase.\n",
      "[09:12.120 --> 09:15.120]  And as I shared that we are a debt-free company,\n",
      "[09:15.120 --> 09:19.120]  so whatever is annual beta almost same is the tax generation.\n",
      "[09:19.120 --> 09:22.120]  So this is 83 crore of these tax generation.\n",
      "[09:22.120 --> 09:28.120]  So 164 crores, 168 crore is the tax generation, which is almost 100 percent up.\n",
      "[09:28.120 --> 09:34.120]  So we are seeing that whatever the temporary blip was there in the last year,\n",
      "[09:34.120 --> 09:36.120]  so we have doubled quarter after quarter.\n",
      "[09:36.120 --> 09:39.120]  It has taken it a little longer than usual,\n",
      "[09:39.120 --> 09:44.120]  but we are very comfortable with the margins profile now.\n",
      "[09:44.120 --> 09:47.120]  So if we go specifically to the segment wise,\n",
      "[09:47.120 --> 09:50.120]  as I shared that our main lead segment and the faster-flowing segment\n",
      "[09:50.120 --> 09:52.120]  is medical devices.\n",
      "[09:52.120 --> 09:54.120]  So within medical devices,\n",
      "[09:54.120 --> 09:57.120]  our BT monitor and Blu-Co monitor are the two products.\n",
      "[09:57.120 --> 10:00.120]  Blu-Co monitor, as for the industry report, we have 19.\n"
